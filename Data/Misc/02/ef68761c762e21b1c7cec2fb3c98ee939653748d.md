**Overall Impression:**

This document outlines a data analysis challenge for RetailWise Inc., requiring cleaning of messy Excel sales data (Sales_data.xlsx) from 1000 records. Key tasks involve handling inconsistent formats, standardizing dates, extracting product names ("Theta"), managing missing cost values treated as half the sale, and ultimately calculating total margin (\( \frac{\text{Total Sales} - \text{Total Cost}}{\text{Total Sales}} \)) for specific transactions from a given date (June 14, 2022) using the product filter "Theta" and country filter US.
