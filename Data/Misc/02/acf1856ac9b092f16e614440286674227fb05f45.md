A terminal image shows an error from running `uv run app.py`, specifically a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'fastapi'. This occurred in `/home/vidushilinux/tds-project-1/app.py` on line 9 due to the import statement `from fastapi import FastAPI`. The key issue is that the required Python library, `fastapi`, was not installed.
