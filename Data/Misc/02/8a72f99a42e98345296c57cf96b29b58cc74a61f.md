The image shows a Python script (`burima.py`) interacting via a POST request with a FastAPI server (URL: `http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2`). The input includes a CSV file (`C:/Users/suneh/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv`) and a natural language query ("What is the total sales..."). Upon receiving an HTTP 200 status, it parses the JSON response containing generated SQL code to answer the question.
