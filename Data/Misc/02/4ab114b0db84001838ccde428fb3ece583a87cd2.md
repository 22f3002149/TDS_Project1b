The CLI output shows a successful `podman run` command launching an application inside a container using Uvicorn. The `-e AIRPROXY_TOKEN` sets the token, and `-p 8000:8000` maps the host port to the container's server port (8000). Messages confirm the server process started successfully on localhost:8000.
