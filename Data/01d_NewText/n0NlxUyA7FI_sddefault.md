This playful promotional graphic targets beginner developers seeking GitHub Copilot tutorials. Vibrant purple and blue gradients form the background, accented by cartoon robots (representing Copilot) and an octopus-like figure. A pixelated robot floats near a smiling coder/octopus holding a small rectangle, while another character holds up a triangle at lower-left â€“ all elements designed to capture attention in a fun, accessible style.
