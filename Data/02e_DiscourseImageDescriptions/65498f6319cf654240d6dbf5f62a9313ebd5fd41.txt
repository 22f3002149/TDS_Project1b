This creates the directory specified by `DATA_DIR`, ensuring that if the directory already exists, no error is raised due to the `exist_ok=True` argument.\n*   **Comments:** The code includes comments explaining the purpose of the operations: ensuring that all files are accessed from a "data" folder within the project root and that the "data" directory exists.\n*   **Color Coding:** The code is color-coded for readability. Keywords like `os`, `True` are colored orange, variables are colored cyan, strings/paths are colored green, and operators/symbols are colored white.\n*   **Line Numbers:** The lines of code are numbered, starting from line 35.\n\n\n\n', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
