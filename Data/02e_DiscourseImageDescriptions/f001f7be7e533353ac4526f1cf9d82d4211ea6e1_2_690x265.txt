It details prerequisites for evaluation and the results of a check.\n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n*   **Heading/Greeting:** Begins with "Dear Learner," indicating this is a message to a student or participant.\n*   **Project Requirements:** It states that "Project 1 requires you to pass some pre-requisite checks" with a link to the "TDS Project 1 Evaluation page".\n*   **Prerequisite List:** A numbered list outlines the necessary conditions:\n    1.  Publicly accessible GitHub repository.\n    2.  LICENSE file with the MIT license.\n    3.  Valid Dockerfile in the repository.\n    4.  Accessible Docker image, with a specified `podman run` command.\n    5.  Docker image utilizing the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.\n*   **Failure Warning:** A sentence warns that submissions failing these minimum requirements will not be evaluated.\n*   **Evaluation Results:** A section displays the results of the prerequisite checks:\n    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub and public: PASS"\n    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"\n    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"\n    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image communicates an automated evaluation process, highlighting missing requirements that need to be addressed before a project can be considered complete. The use of "PASS" and "FAIL" clearly indicates the status of each check.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
