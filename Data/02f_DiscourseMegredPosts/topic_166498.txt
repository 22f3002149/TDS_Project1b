# Topic: Chat GPT new release

Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited 
Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important -  the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to @s.anand and the entire course team who designed this amazing course
I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next 
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a code editor (likely a web-based IDE or Jupyter Notebook) displaying Python code and a chat interface (ChatGPT) on the left. The code appears to be related to fetching and parsing content from Wikipedia.\n\n**Code Editor Details:**\n\n* **Code:** The visible code snippet includes comments indicating the purpose of fetching a Wikipedia page and generating a Markdown outline. It involves using the `requests` library to fetch the page and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content.\n* **File Name:** The file is named "Wiki Outline Api.py".\n* **File Path:** The code is located within a directory structure related to the "starlette" and "concurrency" packages (likely Python libraries).\n* **Console Output:** A console panel at the bottom shows a series of file paths related to the "starlette" package during import, followed by "Run successfully".\n\n**ChatGPT Interface (Left Side):**\n\n* **Conversation:** The chat interface shows a conversation between the user and ChatGPT.\n* **User Prompt:** The user prompted ChatGPT to refine a solution.\n* **ChatGPT Response:** ChatGPT responded with an update to handle SSL configurations, by including a workaround for SSL configuration and checking the "PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY" environment variable.\n* **Error Message:** The user then reported a "ModuleNotFoundError" for the "ssl" module.\n\n**In summary,** the image captures a data analyst or developer working on a Python script to fetch Wikipedia content, receiving assistance from ChatGPT, and encountering a module import issue.Screenshot 2025-02-07 at 7.08.14 PM1920Ã—1012 120 KB
