Here's a detailed description comparing expected and actual outputs from testing `format.md`:

**Expected:**
*   Header line: "# Header"
*   Table columns: "Start," "Mid," "End" (represented by dashes)
*   Paragraph text: "Paragraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace."

**Actual:**

```

The test failed ("A2 FAILED") because the actual output did not exactly match the expected format, particularly concerning whitespace handling.
