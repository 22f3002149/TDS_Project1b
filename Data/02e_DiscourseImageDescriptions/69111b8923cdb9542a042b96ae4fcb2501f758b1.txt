This indicates a Python runtime error occurred.\n*   **File Path:** The error trace includes file paths:\n    *   "/lib/python3.12.zip/pyodide/base.py", line 523\n    *   "/lib/python3.12.zip/pyodide/base.py", line 357\n*   **Error Message:** The core error is "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \'scipy\'". This means the Python code tried to import a module named "scipy" but it wasn\'t found in the current environment.\n*   **Explanation:** The message explains that "scipy" is not included in the Pyodide distribution and needs to be installed.\n*   **Installation Instructions:** It provides two methods for installation:\n    *   `await micropip.install("scipy")` in Python\n    *   `await pyodide.loadPackage("scipy")` in JavaScript\n*   **Link:** A link to the Pyodide documentation for loading packages is provided: `https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/loading-packages.html`\n\n**In summary:** The image shows a common error in Python/Pyodide environments, indicating that the "scipy" library is missing and needs to be installed before the code can run.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
