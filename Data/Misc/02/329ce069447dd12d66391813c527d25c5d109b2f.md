This browser developer console screenshot shows an AJAX request blocked by a CORS policy error originating from 'null'. The specific resource accessed was `http://google.com/`, which lacked the necessary "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header. Logs trace the request handling in `index.html` at line:14 and:29.
