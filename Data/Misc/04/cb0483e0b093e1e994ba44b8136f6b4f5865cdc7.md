This image shows an interface for a data science challenge involving weather API integration.

Key elements include instructions to use the BBC Weather API (`bbcweatherapi`) to fetch forecast data for "nun-Sultan".

The task requires extracting `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription`, mapping them into JSON, and handling potential errors like undefined properties.

Interactive buttons ("Check all", "Save") suggest user input validation is part of the exercise.
