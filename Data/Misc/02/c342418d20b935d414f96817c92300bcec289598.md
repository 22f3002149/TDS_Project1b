This automated evaluation summarizes a programming task assessment:

The final score was calculated using `MIN(20, task_score + bonus)`, resulting in 1 point (task_score=0, bonus=1). Prerequisites were all passed: GitHub repository exists (`https://github.com/anshiraj07/TDS-Project-3-2023`), Docker repo is public (`22f3000276/task-agent`), MIT License present, and a valid Dockerfile. However, the `evaluate.py` showed all task results as zeros in a 3x10 grid, indicating failures or incomplete execution for that specific component.

Attached are evaluation logs for reference, with a note that API services may take up to five minutes to start processing.
