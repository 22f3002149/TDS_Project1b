This image shows terminal instructions using `podman` for container operations. Commands include creating a Docker Hub account, logging in (`podman login docker.io`), building (`podman build -t py-hello`) and running (`podman run -it py-hello`) a container named 'py-hello', then pushing it to Docker Hub with the user's actual username replacing `$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`, optionally using `podman tag`. Comments explain each step.
