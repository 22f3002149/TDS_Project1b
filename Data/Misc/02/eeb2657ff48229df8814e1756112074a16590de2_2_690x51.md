This snippet defines a FastAPI endpoint handler for an HTTP GET request at `/api`. The function `api` takes one optional parameter, `class_`, annotated as a list of strings or None. It explains that this parameter should be read from the query string (aliased to 'class' in URLs) due to `Query(alias='class')`.
