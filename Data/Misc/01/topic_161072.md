Post: <p>I missed the end-term exam due to an urgent emergency.</p>
<p>The grading assignment indicates Iâ€™m NOT eligible for a final score. Does that mean this subject wont be considered at all for the final course card?</p>
<p>Can I still take the end-term exam and be excused from submitting the assignments and projects?</p>

Post: <p>Yes, I got I grade, I registered for the courses opting for end term only and not repeating the entire course,</p>
<p>I still got the assignments though, I can complete those, but I am not sure the new ones will be considered for evaluation, please clarify</p>
