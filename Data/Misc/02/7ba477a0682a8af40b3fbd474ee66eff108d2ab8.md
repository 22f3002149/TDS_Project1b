This data science tool UI displays an input field with a problematic GitHub URL (`https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows`). A red outline indicates invalid input. Below it appears a specific error message: "No executed job step matches...". The 'Check' button is likely the source of this validation check, and its status can be inferred from the displayed issue.
