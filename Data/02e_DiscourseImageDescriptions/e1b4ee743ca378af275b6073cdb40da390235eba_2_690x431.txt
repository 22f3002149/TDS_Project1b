The coding appears to involve creating an API endpoint.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n* **Terminal Window:**\n    *   The terminal window is predominantly black.\n    *   It displays lines of Python code that seem to be executing, indicated by timestamped `INFO` messages.\n    *   The code involves handling API requests, specifically for `/api/class`.\n    *   There is output showing a JSON response with student data: `{"studentId":1288, "class":"15"}, {"studentId":1288, "class":"15"}`.\n    *   The code uses Flask or a similar Python web framework, based on the lines containing `app.run` and path definitions.\n\n* **Web Browser:**\n    *   The browser window displays a coding assignment with a green header: "Exam: Sanand.workers.dev16-2025-01-ga2".\n    *   A deadline is displayed: "Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST".\n    *   A score of "5.5/10" is visible.\n    *   The assignment description concerns handling a query parameter "class" in the API endpoint, specifying how it should filter student data.\n    *   A sample API URL, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/class=1A`, is provided as an example.\n    *   There is text highlighting the importance of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and a question regarding the API URL endpoint for FastAPI.\n    *   A code example, potentially a solution or example, is displayed in the browser window with a "..." indicating more code.\n\n* **General UI Elements:**\n    *   The operating system appears to be macOS, based on the dock and window controls.\n    *   Multiple browser tabs are open: "127.0.0.1:8000/api/class=15", "GA2 - Deployme…", "Push Docker Im…".\n    *   A time is visible in the top right corner: 12:12 AM.\n\n\n\n**In summary:** The image captures a developer working on a coding assignment involving creating an API endpoint that filters student data based on class using Python and potentially Flask/FastAPI.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
