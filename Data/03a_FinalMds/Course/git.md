## Version Control: Git, GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the de facto standard for version control of software (and sometimes, data as well). It's a system that keeps track of changes you make to files and folders. It allows you to revert to a previous state, compare changes, etc. It's a central tool in any developer's workflow.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular hosting service for Git repositories. It's a website that shows your code, allows you to collaborate with others, and provides many useful tools for developers.

Essential Git Commands:

```bash
# Repository Setup
git init                   # Create new repo
git clone url              # Clone existing repo
git remote add origin url  # Connect to remote

# Basic Workflow
git status                 # Check status
git add .                  # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"    # Commit changes
git push origin main       # Push to remote

# Branching
git branch                 # List branches
git checkout -b feature    # Create/switch branch
git merge feature          # Merge branch
git rebase main            # Rebase on main

# History
git log --oneline          # View history
git diff commit1 commit2   # Compare commits
git blame file             # Show who changed what
```

Best Practices:

1. **Commit Messages**

   ```bash
   # Good commit message format
   type(scope): summary

   Detailed description of changes.

   # Examples
   feat(api): add user authentication
   fix(db): handle null values in query
   ```

2. **Branching Strategy**

   - main: Production code
   - develop: Integration branch
   - feature/\*: New features
   - hotfix/\*: Emergency fixes

3. **Code Review**
   - Keep PRs small (<400 lines)
   - Use draft PRs for WIP
   - Review your own code first
   - Respond to all comments
