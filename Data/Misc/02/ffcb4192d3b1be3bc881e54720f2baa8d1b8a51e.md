This image shows a code editor displaying two files: "format.md", containing unformatted content with inconsistencies (heading "#Unformatted Markdown", a paragraph, and lists using different symbols), and ".env". A Python print statement ("print('user@example.com')") appears in another file ('app.py' or 'evaluate.py'), alongside visible line numbers indicating the editor's dark theme.
