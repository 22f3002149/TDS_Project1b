# Topic: My score are still not updated

my score from week 2 to week 5 are still showing not submitted.
Here is a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image showcases a screenshot of an online learning platform or course progress page. It presents a list of modules and assignments with associated scores.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Modules:** The page is structured around several modules:\n * Module 1: Development Tools\n * Module 2: Deployment Tools\n * Module 3: Large Language Models\n * Module 4: Data Sourcing\n * Module 5: Data Preparation\n* **Assignment Details:** Within Module 2 (Deployment Tools), there’s a listed assignment titled "Graded Assignment 2."\n * **Due Date:** The assignment had a due date of February 2, 2023.\n * **Submission Status:** The status indicates the assignment has "Not Submitted."\n * **Scoring Columns:** There are three columns related to scoring: "Your Score", "Peer Average", and "Median Score." All are currently empty, presumably due to the assignment not being submitted.\n* **Expandable Sections:** Each module appears to be designed with a dropdown arrow indicating the ability to expand and view details.\n* **Visual Style:** The interface appears clean and modern with a light-colored background and simple, rectangular containers for modules and assignments.\n\n**In essence, the image illustrates a learning platform tracking a student’s progress through a course with details on assignment due dates, submission status, and scoring metrics.**Screenshot 2025-02-22 1812571144×704 30.8 KB
