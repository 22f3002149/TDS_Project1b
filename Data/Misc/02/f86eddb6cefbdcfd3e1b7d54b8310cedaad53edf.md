**Docker Image Evaluation Feedback**

This email reviews your submitted Docker image (ID: 6144c8c6340a). The evaluation log file is missing, preventing full assessment. Performance must meet the target response time under 5 minutes on an 8-core Xeon server with adequate bandwidth.

Other required files are attached or provided via link. The solution script utilizes prompt engineering techniques. Scores aren't final and feedback bugs/ discrepancies; resubmission options exist before Tuesday's weekly reset.
