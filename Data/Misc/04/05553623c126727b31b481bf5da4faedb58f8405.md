**Subject:** Project Evaluation Results

This email outlines prerequisites for a "Project 1" evaluation on a mobile phone screenshot. The sender reports five minimum requirements: a public GitHub repository, an MIT LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, and proof of running via podman (with the same image). However, all three checked prerequisites are marked **FAIL**, resulting in a Project 1 Score of 0 from the TDS Team.
