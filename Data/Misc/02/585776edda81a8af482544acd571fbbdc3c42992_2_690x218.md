This image shows a flawed Markdown extraction from a PDF using Prettier v3.4.2. It includes a primary heading (#), a Latin paragraph with red underlines ("Tracto adeptio somnus..."), a secondary key point section (##), two bulleted list items, and an error message highlighting missing words like "back" or improperly separated text such as "legislature." The concluding text suggests manual correction is needed for basic formatting elements.
