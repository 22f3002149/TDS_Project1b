This presentation slide titled **"Types of datasets"** introduces three main categories: **Structured**, **Semi-structured**, and **Unstructured** data types, displayed as horizontal orange blocks against a deep purple background. A green subcategory, **Databases**, is positioned below the Structured block. On one side, we see a presenter video call wearing glasses and a maroon shirt.
