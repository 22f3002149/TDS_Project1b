 I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as  Licenese.md  but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).

Post:  So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?

I submitted the project  within the deadline , and I ensured that  all requirements were fulfilled , including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content. 
 However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly. 
 Here is my GitHub repo for your reference:  GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1 (https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1) GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1 
 I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again. 
 Thank you for your understanding.
