This image shows an API debug screen displaying two key issues: (1) A CORS error blocking `OPTIONS` and `POST` requests, suggesting configuration is needed; (2) An 'Expected 3 matches' error occurring when accessing a specific endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`). The white text on black background resembles developer tools interfaces with an input field for the URL and an information icon nearby.
