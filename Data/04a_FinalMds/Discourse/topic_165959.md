Here is an explanation of the image:

This shows JSON data with four key-value pairs, but the object is incomplete due to missing closing curly brace. Below it appears a confusing error message stating "Expected: 2.9 Actual: 2.9", indicating that despite matching values, the system flagged an issue because the preceding JSON syntax was incorrect.

 Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4
 
 FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.

Post:  In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now? 
 edit:  This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?

This image depicts a search results page displaying no matches. On the left are filter options under "Title name" showing the entered query 'Un matrimonio di troppo' and an expandable "Title type." The right side features a prominent message using binoculars graphics saying "No results found," followed by instructions to adjust filters or start a new search, all within a light grey/white color scheme.

Post:  Just a quick query on the Bonus mark. 
 Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?

Post:  @JoelJeffrey (/u/joeljeffrey) @JoelJeffrey  It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.

This image displays instructions for configuring a GitHub repository workflow setup page.

The text outlines three specific steps after creating the workflow: trigger it and wait; ensure visibility in the repo; verify a commit occurs within 5 minutes of the run.

An input field prompts "Enter your repository URL (format: https://github.com/USER/REPO)" but encounters an error trying to parse "https://github.com/23f2603853/workflows" as XML due to its format.

This data science tool UI displays an input field with a problematic GitHub URL (`https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows`). A red outline indicates invalid input.

The 'Check' button is likely the source of this validation check, and its status can be inferred from the displayed issue.

 If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.

Is there any way to crack this , I tired multiple time no improvement. 
Also what does this " It is  very hard  to get the correct Markdown output from a PDF. Any method you use will likely require manual corrections. Reformatting with Prettier helps standardize the output format for comparison." mean.

This image shows an educational resource focused on automating PDF to Markdown conversion. A key exercise presents instructions and prompts users to format a Latin text document using prettier@3.4.2, with feedback indicating the task's difficulty often requires manual corrections despite automation attempts.

Here is the essence of the provided text:

The image shows a GitHub Actions dashboard interface with dark theme and a prominent "Actions" header. A sidebar offers workflow navigation options including management tools like Caches, Attestations, and Runners. The main area displays All Workflows, showing successful Daily Commit runs on branch 'main' (green checkmark) with details about the user who triggered them and completion time ('13 minutes ago'). There's also a filtering field at the top right of the main content.

This screenshot captures a GitHub Actions workflow run history page, using a dark mode theme. Key areas include a header showing the repository name "DigyajitKhodamalTM / TDS_GA" and user icons; a left sidebar listing navigation options like Code, Issues, Pull Requests, and Actions management tools (Caches, Runners etc.).

 In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown content but it was incorrect all the time. 
 I have tried these steps: 
 import pymupdf4llm
md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")

import pathlib
pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())
 
 Then i run this in bash 
 prettier --write output.md
 
 And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups, and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw the preview, it does matches with the pdf. 
 #Can  someone please advise me a better approach?

The code snippet displays actual Osaka weather forecast data but generates an error due to mismatched properties, while a check button is visible for validation.

This image shows a screen capture of dense Latin text presented continuously on a pale green background. The typography uses standard serif font with small size and close spacing, creating high contrast against dark-colored text. Some specific phrases like "crescovito" and "depraedor" are hyperlinked through underline styling, giving it a scholarly or historical digital appearance.

Post:  I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate. 
 Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.

Post:  
 There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf. 
All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as  link texts same as in pdf. 
 
 Link text 
 Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts, 
below error is still observed. 
 Error: Missing links 
 Did anyone else face same issue ? 
 
 Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block. 
But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone. 
 
 Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.

Post:  @21F1005510 (/u/21f1005510) @21F1005510  Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example,  The Recruit (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) The Recruit  is  also known as Graymail in India (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas) also known as Graymail in India . My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles. 
 Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?  Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

Post:  This is the only thing which worked for me. 
 @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton  Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB.  The current example on the portal is:

This image shows JSON-formatted movie data, likely an array of objects in a code editor output. Each object has keys for 'id', 'title', 'year', and 'rating'. Examples include movies released between 2019-2021 with ratings around 5.8-6.2, but the ellipsis indicates more entries exist beyond these two examples shown here.

Post:  Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field. 
 I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction? 
 In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST. 
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.

 I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given. 
 For the particular instance -  “2024–” , it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.

Here's a markdown summary of the image content:

*   This promotional graphic showcases the horror film poster for *Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey*. Key details extracted include its title, release year (2023), runtime (1h 24m), rating (Not Rated), user ratings (~2.9 from 33k viewers), and a low Metascore (16).

# JSON Comparison Error

An error occurred comparing two JSON objects, specifically at the `[1].title` field.

**Expected:** `"2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey"`  
*(highlighted in red)*  

**Actual:** `"2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey"`  
*(highlighted in green)*

The discrepancy lies in the formatting of the number preceding the title, likely causing a data validation failure.

I don’t understand this error. In the website, the movie name doesn’t have a colon “:”, but in the result it is expecting so.

Here is a concise markdown summary of the image analysis:

The displayed JSON snippet describes a movie with ID tt8790086, title "11. Kraven the Hunter" (year 2024, rating 5.4). An error message highlights that the actual title ("11. Kraven the Hunter") does not match the expected format ("11. Kraven: The Hunter"), specifically pointing to a discrepancy at field `.title`.

Post:  For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description. Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can then use to verify the date and description.

This image depicts an assignment for **AgroTech Insights**, requiring programming students to integrate data from the BBC Weather API. The task involves three parts: retrieving location data, fetching weather forecasts (specifically temperature and conditions), and transforming this raw data into a structured JSON format. Example output fields include 'date' and 'description'.

Post:  I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json outcome. Anyways the new json with same issueDate also gives the same Root error

Post:  That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method. 
 But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.

This image is a Python error message in an interactive coding environment (like Jupyter). It shows a `NameError` because the variable 'location_id' used in line 35 to build a weather URL (`weather_url = f'https://www.bbc.com/weather/{location_id}'`) wasn't defined. The program was attempting to find Nur-Sultan's location ID, but failed due to this error.

This analysis describes an image showing a JSON data structure for media titles (like movies). Key fields include `id`, `title`, `year`, and `rating`. The snippet lists several titles, highlighting potential issues like inconsistent naming – here, item 12's actual title "The Recruit" doesn't match the expected entry ("Graymail"). Such discrepancies are common in API or database data validation.

Post:  you have to manually change for a few mismatch. 
 
 
 
   s.anand: 
 
 @21F1005510 (/u/21f1005510) @21F1005510  Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example,  The Recruit (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) The Recruit  is  also known as Graymail in India (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas) also known as Graymail in India . My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles. 
 Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?  Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

Post:  The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated. 
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values: 
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00 
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00 
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you  need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.

 Please help with the second issue. 
 
 For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo. 
How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works. 
 
 
 Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows. 
 
 
 I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

The main issue is CORS errors when accessing local API endpoints (`http://localhost:8000/api/outline` with `?country=...` parameters).

Developer tools indicate blocked network requests from scripts like `exam.js`, `main.js`, suggesting the CORS configuration may not be properly set.

Post:  Agreed and I have tweaked my approach to get the correct answer. But I feel the question instructions should be adjusted accordingly - the question says to get every issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription key value pair - but only 2 such pairs exist ; whereas in the final answer it is forecast date & weather description total 14  pairs.

 Open the BBC Weather website. 
 Press  Ctrl + Shift + I . 
 Select the ‘Network’ menu. 
 Select ‘Fetch/XHR’. 
 Type ‘Karachi’ in the input field on the website.  Do not press Enter  while entering the location; just type the location. Pressing Enter might cause ‘location?api_key=…’ to disappear. 
 ‘location?api_key=…’ will appear in the inspect menu. 
 Double-click it to open a web page ( https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key={api_key} (https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key=%7Bapi_key%7D) https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key={api_key} ). This will give the API. 
 Alternatively, single-clicking ‘location?api_key=…’ will open headers where you can see the Request URL and the API key.

This analysis examines an image displaying JSON output alongside an error message indicating a title discrepancy ("Der Heimweg" vs "The Calendar Killer") during IMDb scraping. A gray informational bar explains regional differences in search results and requires manual translation or periodic script updates, highlighting dynamic website content challenges.

 yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system. 
 but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole  redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.

Here's an analysis of two movies visible in a screenshot: **'Megalopolis' (2024)** has a dynamic poster and shows high user ratings (4.8 stars), but a lower Metascore (55). Conversely, **'Fifty Shades of Grey' (2015)** features a black-and-white poster, is older, has slightly fewer ratings overall (344K vs 33K) though still popular (4.2 stars), and carries the lowest score here with a Metascore of 46. Both entries include rating call-to-action buttons ("Rate") and suggest more detailed information available via "+" symbols.

Post:  i 'm here for the bonus marks, 
 But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this. 
 We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course. 
 And i have never seen any course cool as this, 
 
 like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side ( and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom   :sweat_smile: , gave client side answer checks’s code to  o1  and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this ) 
 keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI. 
(  i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem  :smiling_face_with_tear: )

 if you look closely the expected value is  2024-   and actual that you are supplying is  2024 . 
Difference ? your value does have a  -  and a space at the end. 
reason ? you might be scraping it ?  trim()  or maybe using  innerText  to get tag’s text ?

 For question 2 getting Error: At [8].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “9. Un matrimonio di troppo”. Actual: “9. You’re Cordially Invited” But this movie is not found when searched by name 
 
 the movie may have  different title on IMDb (perhaps in another language) according to region which is why there isnt an exact match u can manually format it to get marks

Post:  Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana. 
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)” 
What am I suppose to do?  @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton   @Jivraj (/u/jivraj) @Jivraj   @Saransh_Saini (/u/saransh_saini) @Saransh_Saini

This image shows an interface for a data science challenge involving weather API integration.

Key elements include instructions to use the BBC Weather API (`bbcweatherapi`) to fetch forecast data for "nun-Sultan".

The task requires extracting `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription`, mapping them into JSON, and handling potential errors like undefined properties.

Interactive buttons ("Check all", "Save") suggest user input validation is part of the exercise.

 Below is the data for Astana that I was able to extract, Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database: 
{ 
“2025-02-09”: “Partly cloudy and a moderate breeze”,

This image shows a webpage analyzing how automating bounding box data extraction (like finding coordinates for cities) benefits UrbanRide by optimizing routing and improving fleet allocation.

It presents the specific task: "What is the maximum latitude..." The example input field contains "24.713599" but displays an error message indicating incorrect latitude, referencing a problematic OSM ID ending with 6590.

 Please include only those are enrolled this term, obviously. 
 If they didn’t attempt GA4, please include them anyway and give them 1/10. 
 If they got 10/10 already, please add 1 mark anyway and give them 11/10.

This image shows a user post from an online forum titled "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The poster 'J', having completed some metrics (168/360), encountered an error: "`Could not find location ID for Nur-Sultan`" while using a Python code snippet. The specific error in the code was "NameError: name `location_id` is not defined", indicating their script lacked this necessary identifier, likely associated with the city's capital status.

Post:  Hello  @s.anand (/u/s.anand) @s.anand   @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton  Sir, 
As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4 I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add that bonus mark to the total kindly. 
 Hoping for a positive response. 
Thanks & Regards

# GA4 Data Sourcing Assignment Forum

This image shows a discussion forum thread about data science assignment "GA4 - Data Sourcing" due in January 2025. A student named 'rohitgang' reported an issue, and the Course TA 'Carlton' responded reassuringly that anyone who received guidance on the Nur-Sultan parameter will get credit for attempting it.

The forum displays typical LMS interface elements including posts by students and replies from staff members within a dark mode theme.

Post:  if a student has 10/10 and his name is in the bonus list, how would that look like in the dashboard? 
 I don’t think it is added in my case.

Post:  It will show up as 110  marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon. 
 Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

Post:  For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5, is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline, but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.

Post:  is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I  understand that each set of students get different questions.  @Jivraj (/u/jivraj) @Jivraj   @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton   @s.anand (/u/s.anand) @s.anand
