**Page Title:** Large Language Models - Course Instructions

This image shows course material on LLMs. Key sections include an expanded "Large Language Models" menu highlighting prompt engineering, and detailed content discussing practical usage with cost limitations ($1/month). Crucially, instructions guide students to configure API access by replacing OpenAI endpoints with a proxy server (aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/) and using the provided AIPROXY_TOKEN instead of their own key.
