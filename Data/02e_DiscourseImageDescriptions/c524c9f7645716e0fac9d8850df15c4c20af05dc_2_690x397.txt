Lighter shades indicate weaker correlations.\n*   **Diagonal:** The diagonal elements of the matrix are always 1.00, representing the correlation of a variable with itself.\n*   **Specific Correlations (as visible in the image):**\n    *   Engine Capacity & Price Retention: Correlation of 0.09\n    *   Price Retention & Avg Daily Distance: Correlation of -0.13\n    *   Engine Capacity & Avg Daily Distance: Correlation of 0.04\n    *   Engine Capacity & Mileage: Correlation of 0.01\n    *   Price Retention & Mileage: Correlation of 0.01\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe correlation matrix is used to understand the strength and direction of linear relationships between different variables in a dataset. It's a valuable tool for feature selection, data exploration, and building statistical models.", thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
