It is predominantly black with text rendered in shades of blue and green. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n*   **Prompt:** The top line shows a user prompt indicating the current user ("vkovalchuk") and the current directory ("/mnt/c/IT_Hadara/TDS_Project").\n*   **Files/Directories:** The main content consists of a list of files and directories within the current directory. Common Linux/Unix directories are visible, including "bin", "boot", "etc", "home", "lib", "media", "mnt", "opt", "proc", "root", "run", "sbin", "srv", "sys", "usr", and "var". Some directories have the phrase "us-merged" appended to them.\n*   **Cursor:** A blinking cursor is visible at the end of the directory list, indicating the input point for the user.\n*   **Formatting:** The directories are aligned and appear to be the result of an "ls" (list) command in a Unix-like operating system.\n*   **Color Scheme:** Blue is used for typical directory/file names, while some directories ("init", "tmp") appear in green.\n\n**In summary,** the image depicts a standard Linux/Unix command-line session listing the contents of a directory.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
