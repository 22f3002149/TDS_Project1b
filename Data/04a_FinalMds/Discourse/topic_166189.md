    We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students. 
If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal. 
Regards, 
TDS TA

Post:  Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time. 
 Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal. 
 The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.  Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists. 
 As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks. 
 Kind regards

This screenshot shows an online assignment interface with multiple browser tabs and clear navigation.

**Header:** Displays "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Large lan."

**Quiz Status Bar (Yellow):** Indicates the assignment ended Feb 5, 2025, at 11:59 PM IST. Features a 'Check All' option and allows saving before checking.

**Guidelines:** Text outlines browser troubleshooting tips, permits resource use including hacking/ reverse engineering due to explicit system acknowledgement, mentions concurrent server checks during verification, and provides a support link.

The user is logged in ("231004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in") with recent saves visible (Feb 1 submissions) reloadable via buttons. A search footer bar appears at the bottom right of this interface showing system time.

Post:  Dear Bhavanagv, 
 The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal. 
 Kind regards

Here's a concise markdown description of the image:

A user interface displays "Recent saves" with three entries featuring green headings, distinct reload buttons (green), timestamps ("2/2/2025") and scores ("4") listed. The minimalist style is enhanced by a dark background, making the green elements stand out clearly against it.

Post:  There are some errors in grading for GA2 and  GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.

This screenshot shows a quiz interface encouraging users to check answers regularly and save progress via buttons. The platform is described as potentially "hackable," allowing external tools like ChatGPT, with reminders that multiple servers must run simultaneously during checks/saves. User details and recent scores are visible above the save history list.
