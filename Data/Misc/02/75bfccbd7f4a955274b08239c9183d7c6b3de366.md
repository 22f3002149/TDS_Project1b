This image depicts a developer debugging a webpage using browser tools. On the left is JavaScript code representing student information (studentId, class). The right side shows network activity via waterfall charts and tables detailing request status, type, initiator, size, and time. A local server runs in the background, while a validation message indicates missing form attributes ('id' or 'name'). Multiple developer tool tabs are visible.
