Post: <p>I am unable to open the files shared by the students I am peer reviewing as I don’t have access to them on my student email. Since we were asked to give access to se2002@study.iitm.ac.in when submitting, I wanted to check how this will work—will the team provide us access, or do we need to request it from the student and wait for them to grant it?"</p>

Post: <p>I have completed my allotted 3 peer reviews, I was wondering if it’s possible to do more peer reviews for extra credit? I ask because all 3 of my allotted peer reviews were empty submissions and I don’t feel like I actually did any work <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=14" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
