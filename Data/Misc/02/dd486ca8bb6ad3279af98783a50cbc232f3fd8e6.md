This report summarizes the prerequisite checks for Project 1 submission via GitHub and Docker.

**Key points:**
*   Checks include public repo, MIT license file presence, valid Dockerfile, and accessible image matching the Dockerfile.
*   Evaluation results show a "PASS" for repository access and Dockerfile/Docker image checks, but a critical **FAIL** because no LICENSE file was found at the GitHub root.

The final prerequisite check fails due to this missing MIT license, resulting in a Project 1 score of zero.
