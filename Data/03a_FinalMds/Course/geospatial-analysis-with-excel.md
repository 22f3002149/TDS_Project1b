## Geospatial Analysis with Excel

[Geospatial analysis with Excel: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a 3D data visualization superimposed on a map of New York City, specifically Manhattan. The visualization features numerous vertical bars of varying heights and colors, possibly representing data points related to locations within the city. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Map:** A detailed map of Manhattan is visible, with streets, waterways, and parks discernable. The map provides the geographic context for the data visualization.\n* **Vertical Bars:** Many vertical bars are scattered across the map, concentrated in Manhattan. These bars vary in height and color:\n * **Color:** Most bars are green, while some are yellow. This suggests a categorical distinction in the data.\n * **Height:** The height of each bar likely represents the magnitude of the data point it corresponds to.\n * **Distribution:** The bars are densely packed in certain areas of Manhattan, suggesting higher values or concentrations of the data being represented in those areas.\n* **Perspective:** The image appears to be viewed from a slightly elevated, aerial perspective, providing a broad view of the map and the data visualization.\n* **Lower Right Corner:** A small text label "Â© 2014 HDS" is present, likely indicating the source or creator of the visualization.\n\n**Possible Interpretation:** The visualization could represent various datasets, such as population density, building heights, economic activity, or any other quantifiable data related to locations within Manhattan. The color coding could indicate different categories or classifications within the dataset.](https://youtu.be_49LjxNvxyVs)

You'll learn how to create a data-driven story about coffee shop coverage in Manhattan, covering:

- **Data Collection**: Collect and scrape data for coffee shop locations and census population from various sources.
- **Data Processing**: Use Python libraries like geopandas for merging population data with geographic maps.
- **Map Creation**: Generate coverage maps using tools like QGIS and Excel to visualize coffee shop distribution and population impact.
- **Visualization**: Create physical, Power BI, and video visualizations to present the data effectively.
- **Storytelling**: Craft a narrative around coffee shop competition, including strategic insights and potential market changes.
