This image depicts a CLI terminal showing instructions. One command installs the `httpie` package and sends an HTTPS request to a URL, while another specifies sending a request to httpbin.org/get with an email parameter (`21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`). The prompt asks for the JSON output body from executing such a command. The displayed JSON includes headers (like Accept-Encoding) and args containing the specified email, presented against a dark background with a blue 'Check' button below.
