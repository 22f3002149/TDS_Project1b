 There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it. 
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE). 
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console. 
 inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
 
 Do not submit or save your answers. 
 All the best!

 We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. 
 It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: 
 
 The chaos of ROE. 
 The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. 
 The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). 
 The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. 
 The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly 
 Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions 
 The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). 
 How limited the time is. 
 
 The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. 
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. 
 Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). 
 I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. 
 Kind regards

Post:  Hello  @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton  sir , for me given constituency was  "SRI GOBINDPUR" 
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency 
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab 
 df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]
 
 is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957 
 using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR 
 
 drive.google.com (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing) drive.google.com 
 
 
  (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing) 
 df_gobindpur.csv (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing) df_gobindpur.csv 
 Google Drive file. 
 
 
 
 
 then i used margin formula as 
 margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100
 
 using this i got answer for 1st question as 
 YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114
 
 which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64 
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these.  Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?

Post:  Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price. 
 What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Round to 2 decimal places (e.g. 123.40). 
 !unzip /content/q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip -d /content/extracted_folder
 
 import os
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup




total_sales = 0
html_folder = "/content/extracted_folder"  # Update if the folder name is different

for file in os.listdir(html_folder):
    if file.endswith(".html"):
        file_path = os.path.join(html_folder, file)

        # Step 3: Read the HTML content and extract tables
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(f, "html.parser")
        
        tables = pd.read_html(str(soup))  # Extract all tables

        for table in tables:
            if {"Type", "Units", "Price"}.issubset(table.columns):
                # Step 4: Filter "Gold" ticket type and calculate total sales
                table["Type"] = table["Type"].str.strip().str.lower()
                gold_sales = table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Units"] * table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Price"]
                total_sales += gold_sales.sum()
# Step 5: Print the result rounded to 2 decimal places
print(f"Total Gold Ticket Sales: {total_sales:.2f}")

Q: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find the shortest path between  Doha  and  Muscat . 
 World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific cities. The distance between two cities is the  Haversine distance (https://pypi.org/project/haversine/) Haversine distance . 
 What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total distance traveled? 
 Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas.

Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it.

Post:  But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about the “collaborating” thing.

Post:  I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me. 
 Kind regards

Post:  I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered. 
 But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to this  :sweat_smile:

Q1 presents the prompt: "Given a dataset which patent(s) have the highest number of claims?" It asks for Patent ID(s), referencing an example like US20220225250A1-20230720. The instruction is to either "Start coding" or "generate with AI".

Q2 only contains its question label and repeats the same instructions: "Start coding or generate with AI".

Question 2 of the patent questions is missing, is it intentional?

 There is only 1 patent question. Intentional, its hard enough to do all questions

How many questions will we be having in our ROE? 
Because I remember Anand sir mentioning 17 questions in the explanation of the difficulty of the ROE

Post:  It completely depends on the ROE. There is just no reasonable way of knowing how many questions ROE will have. If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried.

Post:  Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the mocks.

Post:  Respected  @s.anand (/u/s.anand) @s.anand  ,  @Jivraj (/u/jivraj) @Jivraj  ,  @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton 
 Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time. 
 As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk. 
 I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief. 
 Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated. 
Best Regards, 
Lakshay

Post:  Yeah especially if the system is slow, it takes too much time to download libraries. Colab provides more RAM but it frequently stops runtime and restarting it again is very time-consuming.

This image depicts an interactive cybersecurity task interface from SecurePrompt Technologies. Users must engineer a prompt using an 'AI Proxy token' that tricks a Large Language Model (LLM) into saying "yes," despite explicit programming forbidding it. The goal is to test LLM vulnerability against manipulation, simulating red team attacks on sensitive applications.

Post:  The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem what they are.
