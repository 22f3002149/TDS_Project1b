## Cleaning Data with OpenRefine

[Cleaning data with OpenRefine: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of the OpenRefine interface, a powerful tool for working with messy data. It displays a table with a large dataset (400 rows visible) being processed or refined.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **OpenRefine Interface:** The dominant feature is the OpenRefine web application interface, with menu options like “Open”, “Export”, and “Help” visible at the top.\n* **Data Table:** A tabular dataset is displayed with columns labeled:\n * `case_id`\n * `trade_nm`\n * `legal_name`\n * `street_addr_1_txt`\n * `city_txt`\n * `st_cd`\n * `zip_cd`\n * `naic_cd`\n* **Data Rows:** Several rows of data are visible, containing information about businesses, including addresses, names, and industry codes. Some example entries include "365 Electrician", "Three Sixty Five Electrician", and "LANDIS AGER".\n* **Facet/Filter Panel:** On the left side, there\'s a panel titled "Facet/Filter," indicating that the user is currently using the tool\'s filtering or facetting capabilities to analyze and refine the data.\n* **Pagination:** Below the table header, there are controls for navigating through the data (e.g., "previous," "next," page numbers).\n* **Browser Interface:** The screenshot is taken within a web browser (likely Chrome, judging by the tabs and address bar).\n* **Sidebar Text:** The left sidebar includes text "Using facets and filters" and "Watch these screencasts"\n\n**In summary,** the image depicts the OpenRefine application being used to process a large dataset of business information, likely for data cleaning, transformation, or analysis.](https://youtu.be_zxEtfHseE84)

This session covers the use of OpenRefine for data cleaning, focusing on resolving entity discrepancies:

- **Data Upload and Project Creation**: Import data into OpenRefine and create a new project for analysis.
- **Faceting Data**: Use text facets to group similar entries and identify frequency of address crumbs.
- **Clustering Methodology**: Apply clustering algorithms to merge similar entries with minor differences, such as punctuation.
- **Manual and Automated Clustering**: Learn to merge clusters manually or in one go, trusting the system's clustering accuracy.
- **Entity Resolution**: Clean and save the data by resolving multiple versions of the same entity using Open Refine.
