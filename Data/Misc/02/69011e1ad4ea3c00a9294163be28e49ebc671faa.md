This image captures a form interface with two input fields: one for a GitHub repository link (pattern `https://github.com/user/repository`) containing `"https://github.com/Atimanas-Biswal421/proj1"`, and another for a DockerHub image name (`user/image`). The latter field shows an error icon and "Must match pattern", indicating the format `atimanasbiswal/proj1-tds.final` doesn't comply.
