This screenshot captures a GitHub Actions workflow run history page, using a dark mode theme. Key areas include a header showing the repository name "DigyajitKhodamalTM / TDS_GA" and user icons; a left sidebar listing navigation options like Code, Issues, Pull Requests, and Actions management tools (Caches, Runners etc.). The main content displays all workflows ("Daily Commit") with details: success status via green checkmarks, run number, trigger type ('Manually' or 'Scheduled'), initiator username, branch reference, timestamps indicating recency (e.g., "11 minutes ago," "Yesterday"), and duration icons.
