This document outlines data fields from web request logs for analysis, including IP address, time formatted in GMT-0500 with specific syntax (separated by spaces, quoted), HTTP status codes, and details on successful GET requests aiming to optimize infrastructure. A sample query asks for the count of successful GET requests to `/blog/*` during a Monday 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM window, expecting an answer like "1603", though it currently shows an error message indicating incorrectness.
