# Topic: GA7: Peer Grading Clarification

@carlton Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.
Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:** The image depicts a Google Sheets access request screen. It\'s a digital interface indicating that the user requires permission to view or edit a specific spreadsheet.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Header:** At the top, "Google Sheets" is displayed in a green square.\n2. **Message:** The central message states: "You need access. Request access, or switch to an account with access. Learn more".\n3. **Input Field:** Below the message is a text input field labeled “Message (optional)” for the user to add a note when requesting access.\n4. **Request Button:** A prominent blue button labeled “Request access” is positioned below the input field.\n5. **Illustration:** To the right, a cartoon illustration depicts a person stepping over a barrier of stacked blocks. This visually represents the access restriction.\n6. **Account Information:** At the bottom, the account the user is signed in as is displayed: "22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". This is framed by a blue icon with the user\'s initials.\n\n**Color Scheme:** The background is a light beige. The primary colors are green, blue, and white.\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image presents a typical access-denied screen in Google Sheets, clearly informing the user that permission is required and providing a way to request it.image1756×1156 149 KB
Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a list of instructions or tasks.\n* **Instructions:** The instructions are numbered and detail the creation and sharing of a Google Sheet workbook.\n* **Step 1:** The first instruction is to create a new blank Google Sheet workbook, naming it "ga.7.1.rollno" (with "rollno" replaced by the user\'s IITM roll number excluding the domain).\n* **Step 2:** The second instruction is to share editing rights of the workbook to the email address "se2002@study.iitm.ac.in". A warning states that if this step is not done first on a blank workbook, the submission will not be considered.\n* **Formatting:** The text is formatted as a simple numbered list in a standard font. The email address is underlined.\n* **Overall:** The image likely comes from an assignment or course instruction set, outlining how students should submit their work.\n\n\n\nimage1260×194 29.4 KB
