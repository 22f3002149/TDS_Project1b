This image shows a text prompt asking for a GitHub repository URL ("https://github.com/USER/REPO"). An input field displays "https://github.com/NAMAN-BERI/actions.git". Below it, a red error message indicates failure: "Error: No runs found". The black background enhances the visibility of white elements and the red text. It appears to be an interface screenshot demonstrating interaction with GitHub Actions related data retrieval.
