This image shows an evaluation report from IDS titled "Project 1". It lists prerequisites: GitHub repo, MIT license file, valid Dockerfile, and a public Podman-runnable Docker image. A warning states submissions missing these won't be evaluated. The results show all GitHub checks passed ("PASS"), but the Dockerhub check failed ("FAIL"). Consequently, the overall prerequisite check fails, resulting in a Project 1 Score of zero.
