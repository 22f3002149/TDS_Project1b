This image shows a web browser displaying JSON data related to student IDs and their classes from an API endpoint at `127.0.0.1:8000`. The URL parameter `class` lists multiple values (like '5T', '6X'). A long array of objects, each with unique "studentId" and corresponding "class", fills the screen in a dark theme. The system tray indicates it's likely running on Windows, confirming this is probably for development or testing purposes using developer tools.
