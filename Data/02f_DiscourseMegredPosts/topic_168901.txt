Thanks to the course team for giving us this idea of having snippets for common operations.

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a graphical representation of a Git commit history, likely from a software development environment like Visual Studio Code or a similar IDE. It resembles a branch-and-merge graph.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Branching Structure:** A vertical line with diverging branches indicating commits and merges.\n* **Commit Messages:** Text labels along the branches describe the changes made in each commit. These include messages such as "Merge pull request #2 from deb...", "Added chardet code to get file encoding...", "Rename README.txt.txt to README_LLM.txt", "llm code week-3 23f2000573", "Merge branch \'main\' of https://github.co...", "Merge pull request #1 from painful-bug...", "Aishik Bandyopadhyay signing off painful-b...", "Add link to base64guru website. ritwiktrivedi", "Added one Nominatim API sample and ins...", and "Added file with mock1 data extraction. Adde..."\n* **Color Coding:** Different colored dots along the branches may signify different authors, types of commits (e.g., merge requests, feature additions), or branch names. \n* **"main" Indicator:** A tag labeled "main" indicates the primary branch of the repository.\n* **Visual Cues:** Circular shapes around some commit messages likely indicate a merge commit.\n* **Top Bar:** A banner appears at the top, reading "SOURCE CONTROL" and includes various icons for automation and operations.\n\n**Context:**\n\nThis visualization is commonly found in version control systems to show the progression of changes, branching, and merging activities in a software project. It provides a clear historical overview of code development.image401×374 21 KB
This looks beautiful 
Failure is part of life. My laptop hanged and despite having all the needed resources I panicked and the exam went the way it went. I take this as a lesson. This resource will be refined further. I thank everyone involved. I am glad that many benefitted and were actually able to score well.
