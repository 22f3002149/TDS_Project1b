This screenshot shows a webpage for decoding Base64 encoded images. A prominent input field displays base64 data (including `data:image/png;base64,`). The "Decode Base64 to Image" button initiates the conversion. A preview area and file info section follow, showing details like resolution (`757x66`), MIME type (`image/png`), size (`8.18 KB`), and a download link ("image.png").
