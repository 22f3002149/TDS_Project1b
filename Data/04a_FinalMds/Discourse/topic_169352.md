This screenshot shows a Moodle-based online quiz interface ("TDS 2025 Jan ROE"). Instructions explicitly allow using external resources like the internet and ChatGPT. There's also mention of an optional bonus mark form due by 5 pm IST, along with links for IITM students to join Discourse and Google Meet.
