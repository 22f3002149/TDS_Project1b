All the best,
TDS Team
Would we be able to start work on the questions 1 hour before the exam start time?
@bhashwar_sengupta No that will not be possible. It will go live only at 1 pm.
Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?
Is it 45 minutes long?
No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’
@carlton will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like we had for Weekly GA?
Hello @carlton sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings?
All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving component. These are all available on the Youtube channel
Sir we have to join the google meet for ROE or it’s an open book exam?
Is there a google meet that we have to join for proctoring?
@carlton
I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any consideration on this?
I submitted my request at the following link:
Request for additional time for roe
@carlton Is the exam link enabled yet? Not able to see TDS in the table given at Exam
I am not being able to see the ROE link on the website where it is supposed to appear i.e. https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html
Can someone please inform if it is available for them ?
no it’s not available
Awaiting link

waiting for the quickest 45 min… based on previous GA , i might solve 1 ~ 2 questions.
the questions will be available from 1 onwards?
@carlton The link uploaded on https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html for TDS ROE might be incorrect…
Gmeet link is for support and collaboration. You can raise technical issues in gmeet so we can help you . No proctoring for ROE
can we use ai for coding help
maybe finding the correct exam link is also a part of the exam?

Getting my pet ready to ace the roe. 
sir help i tried in incognito as well
The exam link is working now.
were you able to resolve it ?
Yup! Based on previous GAs, 45 minutes seems pretty short.
HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANSWERS, WHETHER THEY ARE CORRECT OR INCORRECT. JUST LIKE IN GAs?? will we have a “check” button??
Its fine the link is correct. Just that the exam is not available at the moment, we have changed the error message. Exam will start at 1pm. Its also hackable to start before.
You will have a check button
We have updated the error message.
yes … us ai, phone a friend, also ping here…
ping here? does that mean we are allowed to discuss here?
No this thread is only for technical doubts faced by students.
But, you can create another thread to discuss it. Thats much encouraged.
@24f2007378
thank you, got one extra answer because of this.
Thank you Teachers for a great preparation using mock it helped us a lot and really very difficult but interesting exam.
Thanks all for ROE exam. Got 9/10 , mostly guessing many might have got full as prev. mocks conducted in last week was used.
But, I want to  thank for mock sessions , appreciate all you TA’s efforts in last week.  Take care
Regards,
Harsha
I tried many times for correlation question. using numoy, excel, writing explicit function. for all the three, i got -0.7144  as the answer. but the portal showed incorrret.
Challenging ROE. Definitely should’ve studied more 
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image showcases a computer screen displaying a web development environment, specifically focused on a coding challenge and an API request/response testing tool (Thunder Client).\n\n**Left Panel (Coding Challenge):**\n\n* It appears to be a coding platform or IDE (likely VS Code based on the interface elements).\n* A coding exercise with several sub-tasks is visible. The tasks include:\n * "11. Embeddings (1 mark)"\n * "8. Region Containing Point (1 mark)"\n * "9. Shortest Path Between Cities (1 mark)"\n * "10. Calculate correlation (1 mark)"\n* A prompt/question is visible about writing a FastAPI proxy server to serve data from a given URL and to include CORS headers in the response.\n* Code examples in what appears to be Python (FastAPI) are present, illustrating how to handle the URL endpoint and return data. \n* The progress indicator shows "0/10" and "Check all" and "Save" buttons.\n* A timer showing "00:26:36 left" suggests a time-limited challenge.\n\n**Right Panel (Thunder Client):**\n\n* An instance of Thunder Client is open, a VS Code extension for testing APIs.\n* The tool shows a GET request to the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/documents?q=london`.\n* A section shows "Query Parameters" with \'q\' as the parameter and \'london\' as the value.\n* The response to the request is displayed in a JSON format, indicating data being returned from the API.\n* The status code is "200 OK".\n* The response data includes a "div" element with styling information.\n* The request/response details include timestamps indicating when the activity occurred.\n* The bottom section of the Thunder Client shows a list of recent API requests and responses.\n\n**Overall:** The image captures a scene of a developer working on an API-related coding challenge, using a combination of a coding platform and an API testing tool to build and verify the solution. The focus is on handling API requests, processing data, and ensuring proper CORS configuration.Screenshot (92)1920×1080 352 KB
@carlton @Saransh_Saini   Sir, can you please tell me why this was not accepted? here is my code:
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
            return response.text
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

here are the responses:
INFO:     127.0.0.1:51793 - "OPTIONS /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D87738 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     127.0.0.1:51793 - "GET /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D87738 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

thanks a ton @carlton and to all the TAs. Performed much better in ROE than I expected!!
ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it.
Your answer is absolutely correct @23f2000573
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.
Hello Sir"s, @carlton @Saransh_Saini
I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.
I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Text:** The image contains text that reads "Recent saves (most recent is your)".\n* **Button:** There\'s a light blue rectangular button with the word "Reload" written in white.\n* **Timestamp:** The text also displays a date and time: "from 3/2/2025, 1:47:43 PM".\n* **Background:** The background color is a pale green.\n* **Context:** The elements suggest this is a user interface element from a software application, likely indicating recent autosaves or save points.
Kind Regards,
Muthu
Hi @Muthupalaniappan
We have got multiple issues like from other students, we are looking into it and figuring out what all we can do.
Even I had this issue but it was given in question to round off so once rounded off, i would taken as correct
Hello  @carlton
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini as I already showed you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it’s showing 0 and dint get submitted properly…
As you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.

i dont understand why its wrong
you have to filter students with marks 30 or more in maths not biology and then answer to question is total biology mark you have found the total maths mark
Also @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini sir found my previous submissions scores and times:
On 1:17:02PM Score -9
And on 1:20:01PM Score -10
and on 1:21:26PM Score -10
So sir you can please verify with your records and i hope you grant me full marks for this ROE sir.

ohh ok my bad thank you
Hello @carlton / @Saransh_Saini
I  am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.
Could you please consider my request?
Thank you.
Major betrayal - laptop, shut down like 5 times during the test losing 10 solid minutes, i think we should have atleast 1 hour from next term onwards 
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:** The image shows a screenshot of a web browser window displaying a result or status page with red and green color scheme. \n\n**Key elements and details:**\n\n* **Top Banner:** A red banner at the top indicates the result ended on "Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST" with a score of 0. There\'s a "Check a" button next to it.\n* **Main Content Area:** A dark green section titled "Recent saves" with a note that the most recent save is the official score.\n* **Reload Buttons:** Under the title there are three lines, each containing a "Reload" button. Each line also shows a timestamp and a score of "10." The timestamps are:\n * 3/2/2025, 1:41:37 PM\n * 3/2/2025, 1:41:37 PM\n * 3/2/2025, 1:41:33 PM \n\n**In summary:** The image displays a result page, likely from a testing or evaluation system. It shows that the final score is 0 but presents recent saved scores of 10 at various times, suggesting a possible issue with the final score calculation or submission.image633×512 23.8 KB
Sir, I’m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves.
Thank you.
The same happened to me before the exam. Fortunately, I saw it before, and charged my laptop.
Charging wasnt an issue for me, my entire vsc just froze and the screen went blank during the last 5 mins. That was exactly when i got the code for q6 and was trying to get the output and it froze, reopened at 1:45 and the time was up
Hi @23f2000778
No need to worry about that, I have checked in backend your score is 10 of 10.
kind regards
Hi @21f3002158
I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.
Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.
There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.
Kind regards
Hi @21f2000588 ,
I looked in backend for your answers following are your submissions

We will consider your submission of 10 marks since that’s maximum one.
Kind regards
Hi @22f1000535
We will be giving 2 minutes allowance, answers before 1:47:00 will be evaluated, so you submitted at 1:46 so you will get 8 out of 10.
Hi @Muthupalaniappan
We have decided to give 2 minutes of allowance for network problems to everyone, so whoever submitted before 1:47:00 will be evaluated, your submission was at 2025-03-02 13:47:43 with 2 marks
Kind regard
@carlton @Jivraj sir,  I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and  finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process
Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity

9 marks? How were you able to crack the ROE?
Hi @24f2003130
Your last submission before 1:47:00 was at 2025-03-02 13:42:34 with	8 marks, we will consider that.
Kind regards
The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks…I practiced them beforehand and had code snippets ready to use…so I guess that was helpful
Ok sir
Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28
I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches.
Thank you
Thank you so much @Jivraj for taking time out and checking the records and considering my submission.
It means a lot!
Thanks &amp; Regards,

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a screenshot of an online assessment or exam interface. It appears to be a data analysis task, specifically related to calculating Pearson correlation.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Timer:** A timer in the top-left corner shows "00:04:19", indicating approximately 4 minutes and 19 seconds remaining. The score is displayed as "1/10."\n2. **Question Prompt:** A text prompt asks "What is the Pearson correlation coefficient between columns A and B?"\n3. **Instructions:** Below the question are further instructions: \n * "Calculate the sample correlation coefficient using Python, Excel, or JavaScript."\n * "The data doesn\'t have any missing values."\n * "Write the answer rounded to 3 decimal places, e.g. -0.769."\n4. **Input Field & Check Button:** There is an input field where the user is expected to enter their answer, followed by a "Check" button. The status above the input field shows "Checking..."\n5. **Error Message:** A prominent red error message appears at the bottom of the screen, reading "Error! Failed to fetch." and instructs the user to "Please contact the exam team for assistance."\n6. **Save Button:** A "Save" button is visible at the bottom of the screen.\n7. **Disclaimer:** A disclaimer at the very bottom states, "Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated."\n\n**Color Scheme:** The interface uses a dark background with white and green elements for the timer, buttons, and text. The error message is highlighted in red.Screenshot 2025-03-02 1340491885×953 51.3 KB
Hi @23f2004781
I looked for your submissions in backend and can’t find any submission.



 23f2004781:

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Visual**: The image displays a dark teal-colored banner.\n* **Text**: It contains two lines of white text.\n * The first line reads: "Have questions? Join Discourse ([ITM students only])"\n * The second line reads: "Technical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet ([ITM students only])"\n* **Icon**: There is a speech bubble icon next to the first line of text.\n* **Purpose**: The banner appears to be providing support resources specifically for ITM students. It directs them to either a Discourse forum for general questions or a Google Meet link for technical issues.image1130×240 10.2 KB
Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it.
I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.
@s.anand @carlton @iamprasna @Saransh_Saini
Hi @Jayeshbansal
Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.
I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.
Kind regards
i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)
Hi @Jayeshbansal
After deadline we gave allowance for 2 minutes considering network issues students might have faced, so till 1:47:00 all submissions will be considered valid, after that we won’t take any submissions.
Following are your submissions all of them were after deadline

Hello sir, @Jivraj
Do you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then?
Yes, it won’t be considered.
yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save
Sorry @Jayeshbansal All your submissions were around 7 hours after 1:47:00 Pm, that’s why we won’t consider them for evaluation.
Kind regards
Hi @23f3002537
The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

Hello @Jivraj sir,
Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.
I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.
Please re consider this request sir.
@Jivraj Could you please verify if my score will be accepted by you? I saved only once: at 1:47 pm. My roll number is 21f2001573.
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
When will the results of ROE will out.
Probably, by this week
I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.
Regards
Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).
Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.
I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.
Please reconsider if possible.
@Jivraj @carlton
Thank you, much appreciated.
Hi @Yogesh1 @24f2003130 @Muthupalaniappan
Quick update:  I discussed with internal team we are now giving an allowance till 1:48:00.

Hi @Jivraj sir,
I sincerely appreciate the extension and the understanding from the course team. This really means a lot, and I am truly grateful for the support. Thank you for your time and effort in making this possible.

They only started pushing the scores a few minutes ago, so just wait for the update to finish. Check again and confirm after a few hours.
Thanks
Am facing the same issue sir, will wait a few hours and update… I ensured I submitted atleast 5 times till 1:45
I submitted 5 times minimum before 1:45 with a score of 7 @Jivraj @carlton out of curiosity i also submitted thrice after exam at like 2 or so just to know how to solve the other qs withscore of 9. I will get the 7 considered right? I submitted them at like 1:43 or so. Please confirm. It still shows absent
@Jivraj @carlton
Do we get bonus marks for submitting the student feedback Google Form?
Sir , it is still showing absent for me for Roe result, I had submitted before the deadline as well my score was 2/10 but the result is showing absent. Can u please look into this and revert
Any updates sir ? @carlton @Jivraj  It was told, it will be updated in a few hours and now it’s been a day. Am scared!
Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.
Respected Sir,
I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.
Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.
Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.
Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a list of file names with corresponding timestamps and numerical values.\n* **File Names:** Two file names are visible: "2302001330@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" appears twice.\n* **Timestamps:** Each file name is associated with a timestamp in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS." The timestamps are "2023-03-02 17:51:08" and "2023-03-02 13:46:05."\n* **Numerical Values:** Each line also includes a numerical value: "4" and "3".\n* **Format:** The data is arranged in a list format with clear separation between the file name, timestamp, and numerical value.\n* **Background:** The background appears to be a light gray, providing contrast to the text.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the image is a snippet of data likely extracted from a log file or a data record, detailing file names, their associated timestamps, and corresponding numerical values.Screenshot 2025-03-09 at 2.42.50 pm1914×194 12.2 KB
The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered.
Ok sir will the bonus 1 mark also be included for filling the gform, also I had scored 10 later is that also there or only 4 max is present?
yes 1 bonus will be added if you filled the form according to the instructions.
