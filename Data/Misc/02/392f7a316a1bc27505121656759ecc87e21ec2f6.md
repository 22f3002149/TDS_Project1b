This Python script analyzes an uploaded image ("lenna.webp") using libraries like NumPy (`np`) and Pillow (`Image`). It converts the image to a NumPy array (normalized), then uses `colorsys` to convert RGB to HLS color space. The script counts pixels with lightness > 0.219, resulting in **248,985** such pixels identified.
