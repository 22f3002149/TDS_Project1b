The CLI screenshot shows a series of failures attempting to process an image containing a credit card. The first step fails because the specified input image cannot be found, leading to a 500 error. Subsequent steps also fail: writing data to `/data/credit-card.txt` returns a 404 error as the file doesn't exist yet (even though extraction failed), and an OpenAI embedding request receives an unauthorized (401) response.
