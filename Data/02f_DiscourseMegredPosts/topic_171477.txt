# Topic: Project 1 Evaluation second mail is not correct and reports files missing while they are present

Mail I received Yesterday:
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Content:** The image is a screenshot of a text-based evaluation report for a project, likely related to software development or data science. It details prerequisites for evaluation and the results of a check.\n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n* **Heading/Greeting:** Begins with "Dear Learner," indicating this is a message to a student or participant.\n* **Project Requirements:** It states that "Project 1 requires you to pass some pre-requisite checks" with a link to the "TDS Project 1 Evaluation page".\n* **Prerequisite List:** A numbered list outlines the necessary conditions:\n 1. Publicly accessible GitHub repository.\n 2. LICENSE file with the MIT license.\n 3. Valid Dockerfile in the repository.\n 4. Accessible Docker image, with a specified `podman run` command.\n 5. Docker image utilizing the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.\n* **Failure Warning:** A sentence warns that submissions failing these minimum requirements will not be evaluated.\n* **Evaluation Results:** A section displays the results of the prerequisite checks:\n * "Is Docker image present in dockerhub and public: PASS"\n * "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"\n * "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"\n * "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image communicates an automated evaluation process, highlighting missing requirements that need to be addressed before a project can be considered complete. The use of "PASS" and "FAIL" clearly indicates the status of each check.Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-01-071174×451 54.2 KB

Good Morning Sir,
This is my github repo: GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1 ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)
I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me.  Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.
@carlton
@Jivraj Sir, Please look into in this matter, no reply from your side till now and 2 days have been passed.
Apologies for that,
The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.
Kind regards
Hi @carlton,
I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of an email titled "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores".

My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:
GitHub repo
Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your time and assistance!
Hi,
Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.
You talking about me or @23f2000345 ?
Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir?
My GitHub repository for Project-1: GitHub - sudhishssn134/project_1_tds
Thanking You

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:
tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())
You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv.

# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]

Oh OK Sir. I will try it out. Thank You so much sir
Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a log output, likely from a Docker build process, showing various steps of building an application. It\'s primarily text-based, showing commands, file paths, and progress indicators.\n\n**Key elements and details:**\n\n* **Log Output:** The majority of the image consists of lines of text, representing the output of a build process. Each line contains a command or action being performed, along with a time estimate and/or file size information.\n* **SHA256 Hashes:** Numerous lines begin with "sha256:", followed by a long hexadecimal string (a SHA256 hash). These identify specific layers or files being used in the build.\n* **Commands:** Common Docker/build commands are visible, like "COPY", "RUN", "WORKDIR", "unpacking", and "building".\n* **File Paths:** Paths like "/app", "/app/requirements.txt" are shown, indicating the location of files within the build context.\n* **Progress Indicators:** Numerical values (e.g., "3.51MB / 3.51MB," "0.0s") and time estimations ("0.1s," "5.1s") suggest the progress of file transfers and process execution.\n* **Build Details:** A section is labeled "build details" displaying information about the build process. \n* **Metadata:** Information like “Maintainer”, “Labels”, “Base image”, and "Exposed ports" are presented to describe the application.\n* **Text color:** the color of the text is a dark green, while the numerical values are in white.\n\n**In summary,** the image provides a snapshot of a Docker build process. It details the steps taken to create an application image, including copying files, running commands (like installing requirements), and managing layers.Screenshot 2025-04-12 1153421466×702 50.4 KB
Sir, But I couldn’t run the last command you gave,
uv run evaluate.py --email &lt;any email&gt; --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

As I dont have evaluate.py
But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir.
Please guide me after this sir
Thank You So much sir
