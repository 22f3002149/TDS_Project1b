This image shows a developer using VS Code on an automation project built with FastAPI (Python). The editor displays code defining environment variables and API routes (`@app.get("/"`), while the browser window at `localhost:5000` shows a "Not Found" error. A terminal output reveals the ongoing Docker build for deployment.
