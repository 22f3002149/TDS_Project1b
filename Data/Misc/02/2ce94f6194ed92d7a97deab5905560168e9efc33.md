This image displays a **Sorted JSON array** containing four objects with 'name' and 'age' fields. The data shows ascending ages: Bob (11), Emma (11), Grace (14). One object has `'na'` as the name and `null` age, indicating an empty field. The presentation style suggests the JSON is considered **correct** despite this null value.
