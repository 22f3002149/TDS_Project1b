It utilizes a dark background with white and teal text for emphasis.\n\n**Key Elements & Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Title:** At the very top, in bold white text, reads "The Anatomy of an AI Prompt".\n2.  **Prompt Text (Left Side):** A block of text presents a sample AI prompt requesting information about hikes near San Francisco. This detailed prompt is the core of the example.\n3.  **Sections with Labels (Right Side):** The prompt is broken down into four sections, each labeled with a teal bar and white text. These sections explain the core components of an effective prompt:\n    *   **Goal:** ("Each hike should provide a cool and unique adventure, and be lesser known.") Defines the desired outcome.\n    *   **Return Format:** (“For each hike, return the name of the hike as I’d find it on AllTrails, then provide the starting address of the hike, the ending address of the hike, distance, drive time, hike duration, and what makes it a cool and unique adventure.”) Specifies how the information should be presented.\n    *   **Warnings:** (“Be careful to make sure that the name of trail is correct, that it actually exists, and that the time is correct.”) Highlights potential errors or conditions to avoid.\n    *   **Context Dump:** (“For context: my girlfriend and I hike a ton! we’ve done pretty much all of the local SF hikes, whether that’s presidio or golden gate park. we definitely want to get out of town…we did mount tam pretty recently, the whole thing from the beginning of the stairs to stinson - it was really long and we are definitely in the mood for something different this weekend! ocean views would still be nice. we love delicious food. one thing I loved about the mt tam hike is that it ends with a celebration (Arriving in town to breakfast!) The old missile silos and stuff near Discovery point is cool but I’ve just done that hike probably 20x at this point. We won’t be seeing eachother for a few weeks (she has to stay in LA for work) so the uniqueness here really counts.”) Provides background information and preferences to guide the AI’s response.\n\n**Color Palette:** The image uses a dark background (black or very dark gray) with white text and teal accents to highlight key sections.\n\n**Overall Purpose:** The graphic is designed to illustrate a structured approach to crafting effective prompts for AI models, aiming to improve the quality and relevance of the generated responses.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
