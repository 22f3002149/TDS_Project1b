This screenshot shows an ngrok error (`ERR_NGROK_8012`) indicating failed tunneling. The 'ngrok Agent' status indicator displays a red X, showing it couldn't connect to `undefined://localhost:52525`. A visible technical message suggests the local service isn't accessible or running correctly on port 52525. Instructions prompt both visitors (to refresh) and developers (to verify their service).
