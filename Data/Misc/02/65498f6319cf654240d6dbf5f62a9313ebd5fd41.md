This Python code snippet uses the `os` module to manage directories safely. It defines variables for a project root and data directory paths using absolute paths obtained via `os.getcwd()`. Then it creates the 'data' subdirectory with `exist_ok=True`, ensuring no error if the folder already exists, while comments explain its purpose.
