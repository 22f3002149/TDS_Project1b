It displays the output of Docker commands.\n\n**Specific Details:**\n\n1.  **Command Execution:** The terminal shows the execution of two Docker commands:\n    *   `docker pull --platform arm64 rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3` - This command pulls (downloads) a Docker image named `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds` with the tag `v3` specifically for the `arm64` architecture.\n    *   `docker images | grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"` - This command lists all Docker images on the system and then filters the output to show only the image named `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds`.\n\n2.  **Output of `docker pull`:** The `docker pull` command outputs:\n    *   `Digest: sha256:bd2d0e879ec6b9a4a2b156602a7c6abd118c4d10f6ca39e9dd78b0c6cab7542` - This shows the SHA256 hash (a unique identifier) of the downloaded image layer.\n    *   `Status: Downloaded newer image for rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3` - This indicates that the image was successfully downloaded.\n\n3.  **Output of `docker images`:** The filtered output of the `docker images` command displays information about the downloaded image:\n    *   `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds` - The name of the image.\n    *   `v3` - The tag of the image.\n    *   `466630e32b8` - A short image ID.\n    *   `5 weeks ago` - The time since the image was created.\n    *   `581MB` - The size of the image.\n\n4. **Prompt/Username:** The prompt at the beginning of each line appears to be `usr/22f3002542_ds_study_iitm_ac@tds-course-temp-bo:~$` indicating the user, host, and current directory.\n\n**In essence, the image shows a user pulling and verifying a Docker image named `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds` with the tag `v3` on an ARM64 architecture system.**', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
