Post:  Sir, 
I haven’t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks. 
Kindly, update my marks in dashboard.

Here is a detailed description of an image showing a course announcement encouraging ITM HS students to post on Discourse regarding Q14 - Data Science - Declaration Third (ITM HS Jun 2023) for bonus marks.

 We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction. 
 That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4. 
 Kind regards
