This image depicts a screenshot of an online learning platform's completed challenge interface. The session ended recently at night on Feburary 2nd, 2025 (Sunday), displaying a final score of zero. Key elements include buttons for 'Check all' and 'Save', a teal discussion box, user login details showing the email format `user@domain.com`, and recent saved scores of 6.5. The inference is that this shows a recently finished session with platform tracking features, despite the displayed challenge completion score being zero.

 Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed. 
 GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

 Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem. 
(Its a data cleaning and packaging issue - a typical TDS problem  :rofl: )

Post:  @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton  sir, 
I recently checked my marks for Tool in Data Science and noticed a major discrepancy. In the subject dashboard, my marks are shown as 100  , but in the main Dashboard, I have been awarded absent .

This screenshot depicts an online learning dashboard from IIT Madras focused on Data Science courses. The header shows user info and "Latest Updates." Four main course cards display titles such as Business Data Management, Tools in Data Science, Machine Learning Techniques, and Modern Application Development I. Each card lists assignment scores for different weeks (e.g., Week 1: Absent or specific percentages) alongside a button to access the course page ("Go to Course page >"). The interface uses a dark red, white, light gray color scheme with textured backgrounds on the cards.

 I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1. 
 Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks. 
 The actual score will be in the dashboard soon. 
 Kind regards.

Post:  Sir for the GA3 the saved score says its 4.5, total is 9.5 so my total should be 47.4.

The image shows three text lines representing data entries, likely from logs or records.

Each entry includes:
1.  An ID starting with "tds-2025"
2.  An email address ending in "@iimv.ac.in"
3.  A timestamp in ISO format ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS")
4.  Two numerical values separated by a space

This simple text-based data format appears to track events or transactions associated with the IIMV domain.

 According to your submission history your last submission before the deadline was 3.5 (i.e. your score would be 36.8 out of 100) 
 Kind regards

Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab. 
I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.

Post:  @shubham6 (/u/shubham6) @shubham6  I have checked the backend server. It does show your score as 8 for GA2, so we have the correct score for you. 
 Can you send me a screenshot of your dashboard (where your course cards are) thanks. 
 Kind regards
