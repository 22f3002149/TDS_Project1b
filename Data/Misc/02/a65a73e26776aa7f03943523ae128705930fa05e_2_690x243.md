This image shows a dark terminal displaying an error from a FastAPI endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`). The instructions specify filtering results by the `class` parameter (e.g., `/api?class=1A`). However, the extensive JSON response lists student IDs without correctly applying this filter as intended during debugging.
