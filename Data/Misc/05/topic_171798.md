Post:  Even if I pass in end term TDS, Can I repeat the course in next term because I missed project1 and my CGPA will go down because of it? 
 This is my last term of diploma. So, can I take 1 diploma course and rest degree courses in next term?

This text outlines university policy for repeating courses ("Improvement Courses") to enhance understanding, available only for grades A-E and capped at a 'CCC Limit'. Key points include: official transcripts reflect the highest grade achieved; students are strongly advised against repetition unless absolutely necessary. Repeated courses incur double fees but offer flexible registration levels. All course materials remain accessible regardless of repetition status.

Post:  TDS is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve CGPA. 
 Its better to take a high credit, easy course to improve CGPA.  We never recommend taking TDS for grade improvement.  If you have passed it, its better to move on.
