This image shows Python code implementing semantic search via vector embeddings. It demonstrates storing documents by generating `mxbai-embed-large` embeddings using Ollama and adding them to a collection with assigned IDs. Then, it retrieves the most relevant document for an example query ("What animals are llamas related to?") by querying the collection for similar vectors (`n_results=1`).
