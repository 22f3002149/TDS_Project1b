This image shows a user registration/login form fragment. It displays two input fields: one for "Username", currently showing "navya" with an availability check failure and suggested alternatives; another for "Password", with validation requirements displayed (minimum length or specific complexity rules). The UI features rounded corners, light grey background, and uses visual cues like red error symbols to indicate failed validations. This demonstrates aspects of user input processing, data validation logic, security constraints, and error handling design in software interfaces relevant to teaching data science concepts.
