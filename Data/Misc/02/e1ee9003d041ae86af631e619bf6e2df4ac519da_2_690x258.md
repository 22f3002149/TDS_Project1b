This image depicts an interactive cybersecurity task interface from SecurePrompt Technologies. Users must engineer a prompt using an 'AI Proxy token' that tricks a Large Language Model (LLM) into saying "yes," despite explicit programming forbidding it. The goal is to test LLM vulnerability against manipulation, simulating red team attacks on sensitive applications.
