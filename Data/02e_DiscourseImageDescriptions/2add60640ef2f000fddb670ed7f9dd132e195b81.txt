The background is black with white text.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Command Sequence:** Several commands were executed:\n    *   `cd downloads`: Changes the directory to "downloads".\n    *   `certutil -hashfile C:\\Users\\sarva\\downloads\\README.md SHA256`: Calculates the SHA256 hash of the file "README.md" located in the downloads directory. The resulting hash is `eef23369e30d7b099173ef4988c65a59b80b0f56f60a4c9ab95c1903be312317`. A success message follows.\n    *   `npx prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt`: Formats the "README.md" file using the "prettier" package and redirects the output to a new file named "output.txt".\n    *   `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 output.txt`:  Calculates the SHA256 hash of the "output.txt" file.\n\n2.  **Hash Output:** The `Get-FileHash` command provides a table with the following columns:\n    *   **Algorithm:**  "SHA256" (the hashing algorithm used).\n    *   **Hash:**  `CECFD0A2CD971DE14A28CABB9F8ED854A9E6C7A94B9D788AB0D10F5D991A4F64` (the calculated SHA256 hash value).\n    *   **Path:**  `C:\\Users\\sarva\\downloads\\output...` (the file path of the processed file)\n\n3.  **Prompt:** The command prompt indicates the current directory is `C:\\Users\\sarva\\downloads`.\n\n**In essence, the image demonstrates the process of calculating and verifying file hashes using command-line tools.** This is commonly done to ensure the integrity and authenticity of files.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
