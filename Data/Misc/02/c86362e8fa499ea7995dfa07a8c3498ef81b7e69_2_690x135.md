This image shows an error during API testing at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. The response lacked a defined structure compared to expected JSON containing 'studentId' and 'class' fields, like `"studentId":57,"class":"SN"`. A troubleshooting plan involves adding the '?class...' parameter for verification.
