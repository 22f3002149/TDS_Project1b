## Regression with Excel

[Regression with Excel: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet displaying statistical regression analysis output. \n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n* **Excel Interface:** The top of the image shows the standard Excel ribbon with tabs like "File," "Home," "Insert," "Data," etc. \n* **Data Table:** The main part of the screenshot displays a data table filled with numbers and text labels. The table includes headers like "Coefficients," "Standard Error," "t Stat," "P-value," "Lower 95%," and "Upper 95%."\n* **Regression Analysis Output:** The data table presents the results of a regression analysis. Rows represent different coefficients (like "Intercept," "new_cases_per_thousand," "new_tests_per_thousand," etc.), with corresponding statistics for each coefficient.\n* **ANOVA Table:** A portion of the table towards the top appears to be an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) table, displaying values for "df," "SS," "MS," and "F."\n* **Residual & Total:** Rows labelled "Residual" and "Total" are present, likely representing the sums of squares and degrees of freedom for those components of the model.\n* **Data Values:** Numerous numerical values are visible within the table, indicating the results of the statistical calculations.\n* **Status Bar:** The bottom of the screenshot shows the Excel status bar with information like "Ready" and page number.\n* **Desktop Environment:** The screenshot seems to be taken from a Windows operating system, as indicated by the taskbar and icons.\n\n**In essence, the image displays a statistical analysis performed in Excel, likely used for modeling and interpreting the relationship between different variables.**](https://youtu.be_AERQBMIHwXA)

You'll learn to perform regression analysis using Excel, covering:

- **Data Preparation**: Understanding the cleaned dataset and necessary columns for analysis.
- **Enabling the Tool**: How to enable the Data Analysis Tool Pack in Excel.
- **Types of Regression**: Differences between simple and multiple linear regression.
- **Setting Up Regression**: Steps to input dependent (new deaths) and independent variables (new cases, new tests, new vaccinations, stringency index) for the analysis.
- **Interpreting Output**: Reading the regression output, focusing on adjusted R-squared, significance value (F-test), and P-values.
- **Coefficient Interpretation**: Understanding the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, including scaling factors (per 1000 units).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model based on significance values and understanding the implications of unexpected results (e.g., stringency index).
- **Further Analysis**: Recognizing the need for additional analysis when encountering unexpected or inconclusive results.
