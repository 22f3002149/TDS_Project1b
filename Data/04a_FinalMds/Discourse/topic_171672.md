This report summarizes the prerequisite checks for Project 1 submission via GitHub and Docker.

**Key points:**
*   Checks include public repo, MIT license file presence, valid Dockerfile, and accessible image matching the Dockerfile.
*   Evaluation results show a "PASS" for repository access and Dockerfile/Docker image checks, but a critical **FAIL** because no LICENSE file was found at the GitHub root.

The final prerequisite check fails due to this missing MIT license, resulting in a Project 1 score of zero.

This markdown tutorial screenshot shows how to add an open source license template to a GitHub repository using the 'Choose a license' wizard (step 3). It displays a code editor interface (`LICENSE` file creation, step 4), highlights the key actions needed like selecting a template and editing files.

 I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as  Licenese.md  but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).

Post:  So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?

This image displays commit logs from a version control system, authored by 'viraptale'. It shows four verified changes related to updating and renaming license files (License.md and LICENSE.md) occurring between February 15th and April 3rd, 2025. The commits also reference other project updates like the initial creation of the software.

I submitted the project  within the deadline , and I ensured that  all requirements were fulfilled , including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content. 
 However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly. 
 Here is my GitHub repo for your reference:  GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1 (https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1) GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1 
 I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again. 
 Thank you for your understanding.
