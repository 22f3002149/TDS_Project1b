Hi Guddu,
Can you share your GitHub repo. For GitHub pages question.
Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.
Try adding CORS to your code it might work.

Hi Mishkat,
Please use  triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.
eg
if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.
Thanks and kind regards

Hi Mishkat,
This error is because you are filtering on class_ instead of class
So if you send a request on http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S you will see response for that 1S class only.
kind regards
thank you so much after modifying the code it got accepted
Hi Guddu,
Inside index.html file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.
This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

Hi Telvin,
Try opening localhost:8080 in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.
I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.
kind regards
kind regards
@Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop.
Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.
@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.
@22f2001640 in that case

a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested

You could try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work.
Thank you, Sir!

What is the Docker image URL? It should look like: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general

If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps correctly?

@carlton my answer got excepted before but now it is only working on the terminal after I modified the code but when I paste the url in the answer box it is again showing error
Hi Mishkat,
The GA url encoded parameter is class
In your screenshot, you are using class_
Your code that we examined earlier also accepts class_ as the parameter instead of class as required by the GA
The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter class

@Jivraj this is the code I’m executing which is not getting accepted in the answer box the last time I modified the code it got accepted and I also saved the answer but when I reopened the page till now it is not getting accepted
Hi Mishkat,
In your code, the word class is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing class_ to class is not going to work. The only thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api not the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.
Kind regards

Hi Aindree,
I tried to send a request to your application https://your-app2.vercel.app/api with url encoded parameter class=7Q. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends {"marks": []}.
Check if your csv file is correct.  Also check if code is correct.
Kind regards
Jivraj
For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue
@s.anand
Hi Tushar,
For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.
For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.
Kind regards
Jivraj

Hi,
I have downloaded the Llamafile as instructed. But I can’t run it on my mac. It says command not found.
Pls let me know what I should do.
For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.
Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.

While I understand why you might choose to use flask due to your familiarity with it,
the http.server library is just very simple to use.
The only extra line of code you would need inside your get request if you used the http.server library would be:
self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
Try to rewrite your code using http.server  library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.
The boilerplate code for a get request using the http.server library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.
Kind regards

@23F300327 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.
GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.
Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.
Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.
There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.
The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy

@23F300327
Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.
When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api
with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.
The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.
That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this
# api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return

Notice there is no if __name__ == "__main__": code block.
This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.
if __name__ == "__main__": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.
Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.
Another possible problem:
By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS &gt; Development Tools &gt; unicode
So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.
Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.
Kind regards

I think url that you are submitting is wrong one. In below image there are two url’s under Domains those would be correct url’s to be submitted.

I tried both the url in domain still it is showing failed to fetch
Hi NamanBeri,
Just remove .git it will work.
[UPDATE 22/02/2025]: GA 2 NEW DEADLINE: 2025-02-02T18:29:00Z
I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a vercel.json configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code.
You can follow Gui Bibeau’s guide to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.
For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to this guide on DEV Community. I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.
Okay,  I’ll try to it again using these methods and let you know
Thank you

From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are submitting in answer is not running.
For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to keep all the server’s running when you submit
Kind regards

that means at every time i need to run the system at backend when i submit. hows that possible it requires very lengthy process. When i had submitted thats showing correct again i have reloaded the previous one showing wrong.

I tried using github codespace for ngrok  and cmd for llamafile, but im still encountering the same error no matter which port i use @Jivraj
Hi Naman,
error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a google search Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is &amp; How to Fix It). I tried submitting now while replying at 2:45 am it was working fine.
@s.anand Is there any problem from our end, such as tds hosting server receiving lots of traffic on website.
Hi daniyal,
Tools in Data Science you can get calendra invite link from here and add to google calendra.
Hi Srividhya,
This error is because you are trying to access a feature of ngrok which requires to pay ERR_NGROK_501 | ngrok documentation.
I think you didn’t use authtoken to authenticate through your laptop. Follow second step on this page Quickstart | ngrok documentation to authenticate.
kind regards
Jivraj
Hi Irina,
This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine.
Here is reference of error ERR_NGROK_8012 | ngrok documentation

I’m leaving the url running, you can see you get a dummy response(clicking the link), how should i go about it. I’d prefer to use codespaces. Please help me
No problems, I got it , SOLUTION just made the port public
for the tunneling, i am currently unable to do it has the ports are mismatched, I’m still working on the issue, but using codespaces and public ports i’ve achieved similar results and the question is marked right. Is this wrong/unethical. I will try to tunnel using ngrok though

@23f1002382
Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.
That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.
Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!
So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.
In the meanwhile:

There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.
Kind regards
thank you. you have no idea how much this helps sir
Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.
Can you clarify why this is happening?
because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.
Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.
The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.
Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”
Kind regards
hi @23f2003853
I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify  ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of 127.0.0.1. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.
Hello Sir,
I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.

Hi Shalini,
I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.
Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel,  just check your code if it’s logically correct.
Kind regards

could you also give me a hint
I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.
In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)
I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp.
Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

Hi @daksh76, Can you mention exact error or problem that you are facing.
The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using 127.0.0.1 and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with http://localhost:8000/api to see if it works.
If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the ipconfig command to check the correct IP address.
We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

This url shows correct but after few hour it shows this error
@carlton  pls help me to fix this
you need to keep the services running. Else it will fail. Do whats required, regenerate that link and paste it once you complete and save it. this way you can avoid rework.
sir the output im getting after correcting the code is showing incorrect on the portal
if you could suggest me why is that happening, where am i making an error because i have cross checked this a lot of times and still am unable to understand where i might be making a mistake
I had faced the same issue. Please ensure the url is not protected against the access of third party (IITM will access your url. To check it, try to open the url in different browser)
Hi sakshi in vercel problem i also had similar error. remove this code if name == ‘main’:
24 # app.run(debug=True) frm your flask app then run it. it worked for me i found this with the help of chatgpt. vercel has some built in features to run so this is not required it seems.
I was facing problem that how to make a class as variable name for Q9 in GA2 . but now i get a solution which was helpful for making class as variable. The below command is the solution for the problem of how to make a class variable name in python.

the async def root() this command line in image is solution for our problem.
Hi Srividya,
Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.
This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).
In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.
This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.
Thanks for your input.
Kind regards
@carlton @Jivraj  sir pls help me to fix this issue
Questions 9 and 10 require running a development server from my side. Right now, the questions are marked correct and I’ve saved the assignment. Since the servers won’t always be running, I hope this won’t cause a problem during evaluation.

Hi @23f2004644 and @bhashwar_sengupta ,
You would need to keep all the servers active whenever you click on save button.
Hi @23f2003853 ,
did you enable cors ? If yes then pls send screenshot of console and network tab.
Kind regards
So if I kept the server running and saved the answer, but after reloading it’s showing incorrect
We can’t just keep it running.
Hi @daksh76 ,
I didn’t actually used python to solve this particular question.  I tried for some time but it was not working. So I just used Squoosh, for now pls use this.
whenever you want to submit your answers by pressing save button at that time only all servers should must be running.
I did that, while running all the severs i saved my answers and it showed “correct”.
But after sometime when I re-loaded my answers it showed incorrect.
Hi @24ds1000082_Vivek, @23f3004114 ,
You guys are not using correct format for response.
{
  "students": [
    {
      "studentId": 1,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 2,
      "class": "1B"
    }, ...
  ]
}

This is correct for which have a object with key students which is not present in your response.
kind regards
That’s okay, when you click on save answers button just make sure all servers are running.
Yes Hari, most probably that’s what the problem is. @23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL Check if cors are enabled.
Kind regards

Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.
Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.
Do I need to do anything else ?
Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.
Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks &amp; regards.

Yes sir. I did keep them active when saving the assignment and the answers were saved successfully(The score was 10/10). I was talking about evaluation after deadline.
In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with --n-gpu-layers 35 parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that.
@carlton @Jivraj did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.

please look into this @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini
https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&amp;name=m
Try these @21f3000745

Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.
If this doesn’t work, then:
Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.
Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

yeah it worked. thankyou @Saransh_Saini
actually on every reload of page , it generates new data which makes question so tedious.
So the problem was with the JSON data or you just clicked again on check and it worked?
i loaded the data again as you said and clicked on check again. then it gave correct
Hi @24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ ,
For the ngrok tunnel question and any other question requiring a server URL, make sure to keep all servers running when clicking the Save button.
Also, I couldn’t find the GitHub Pages URL in your GA2 response, and many answers are unmarked. It seems you didn’t click the Save button.
Your current score is 4.5/10.

Not able to submit GA2 assignment Since I’m seeing this page there is no submit   button available.Will it take last saved for  submission.
I am facing several problems with the submission portal …


In question  no 5 I entered the answer 78918 It was correct , I submitted it after few hours when I reloaded the portal its showing incorrect … I tried to enter twice thrice also solved it again but no use…


In question 10 I entered the required link it was correct after saving it and reloading the portal it shows incorrect …


In question 9 I did all the necessary thing but the portal is showing couldn’t fetch … My system is able to fetch the data but the portal says “failed to fetch”

Hi @23f2000573 ,
As error mentions to add tag to image.
Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a particular tag can be pulled.
For adding tag use

For GA2 there is not question that asks if you visited GA2 page or not.
Just answer on GA2 page TDS 2025 Jan GA2 - Deployment Tools.
Hi @24f1002359
For Question 10, ensure that all servers are running every time you submit (click the Save button). Since ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs, double-check that the ngrok URL is correct before submitting.
For Question 9, did you enable CORS? To verify, check your browser console—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.

Hi @24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ ,
That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a GitHub Page. To disable this protection, create a .nojekyll file in your root folder of your repository.

Gentleman,
Will you consider my mark or not ?
Gentleman,
I dont understand. I just now, on triggering the Github action, I copied the url of my github repository. It worked !
The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.
If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.
I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.
I had submitted the assignment in the evening, but now in the portal it’s showing not submitted.

same problem, please sir @carlton consider this GA marks otherwise our efforts will be wasted
We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students.
If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

Does this go for GA1 also ?
Yes. The scores you achieve in the TDS portal are your scores for the GA. It’s not necessary to do anything on the Seek Portal.
Actually even on the portal it’s showing like this:
