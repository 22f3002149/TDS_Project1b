The image shows three text lines representing data entries, likely from logs or records.

Each entry includes:
1.  An ID starting with "tds-2025"
2.  An email address ending in "@iimv.ac.in"
3.  A timestamp in ISO format ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS")
4.  Two numerical values separated by a space

This simple text-based data format appears to track events or transactions associated with the IIMV domain.
