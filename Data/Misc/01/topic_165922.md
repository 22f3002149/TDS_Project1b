Post: <p>Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?</p>
<p>That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.</p>

Post: <p>Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation</strong> – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reproducibility</strong> – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Portability</strong> – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><strong>Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>• Good for quick experimentation and testing.</p>
<p>• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Using requirements.txt</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>• Best for <strong>reproducibility</strong> and <strong>collaboration</strong> since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.</p>
<p>• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.</p>
<p><strong>Specifying Versions in requirements.txt</strong></p>
<p>• If you <strong>don’t specify a version</strong>, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.</p>
<p>• If you <strong>do specify a version (package==1.2.3)</strong>, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.</p>
<p><strong>Handling Version Conflicts</strong></p>
<p>• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.</p>
<p>• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:</p>
<p>• Using <strong>greater than/less than constraints</strong>: package&gt;=1.2,&lt;2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).</p>
<p>• Running pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).</li>
<li>Use a <strong>requirements.txt</strong> file for reproducibility.</li>
<li>Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.</li>
<li>Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kind regards</p>

Post: <p>For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.</p>
<p>Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement</p>

<p>Coming to your second question,</p>
<p>The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.</p>

<p>The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, <code>pip3 freeze &gt; requirements.txt </code>. This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you</p>

<p>I wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question.</p>
