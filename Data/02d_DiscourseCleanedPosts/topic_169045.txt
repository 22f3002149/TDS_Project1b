Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread
Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments
Why? <img alt=":interrobang:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_169045/interrobang.png" title=":interrobang:" width="20"/><img alt=":thinking:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_169045/thinking.png" title=":thinking:" width="20"/>
If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?
Too many Questions for LLM <img alt=":nerd_face:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_169045/nerd_face.png" title=":nerd_face:" width="20"/><img alt=":nerd_face:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_169045/nerd_face.png" title=":nerd_face:" width="20"/><img alt=":nerd_face:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_169045/nerd_face.png" title=":nerd_face:" width="20"/>
True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer
What We need from YOU 🫵🏽
Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?
How?

If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful <img alt=":+1:t3:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_169045/3.png" title=":+1:t3:" width="20"/><img alt=":+1:t3:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_169045/3.png" title=":+1:t3:" width="20"/>

## Student Assignments Directory Structure

Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
- A `.txt` file with the question statement.
- A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.

### Example Directory Structure
RollNo_12345/
├── Assignment_1/
│   ├── Q1.txt    # Question for Q1
│   ├── Q1.py     # Solution in Python
│   ├── Q2.txt    # Question for Q2
│   ├── Q2.sh     # Solution in Bash
│   ├── Q3.txt    # Question for Q3
│   ├── Q3.js     # Solution in JavaScript
