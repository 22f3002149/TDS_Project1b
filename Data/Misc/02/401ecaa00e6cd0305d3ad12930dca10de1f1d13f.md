This promotional graphic uses server rack imagery to vividly contrast Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers in an educational tech presentation context. On the left, blue-green monitors display labels like "Virtual Machines," "Email," "Webserver," and "Database." The right side features green-red-yellow displays with text such as "Containers" and charts. A large white overlay states "VMs vs CONTAINERS," while bottom animations highlight each side, and a "PowerCert" logo adds branding to this clear visual comparison emphasizing their distinct roles in modern computing environments.
