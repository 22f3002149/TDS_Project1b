# **Module 1 Assignment**

This image shows a student view from an online course platform at IIT Madras (Jan 2025-TDS). The left sidebar displays the expanded "Development Tools" module containing "Graded Assignment 1". On the right, assignment details are listed: due on Jan 26th. Troubleshooting tips include disabling ad blockers and browser extensions for accessing the site.

A critical instruction states students *must* use their student ID to complete evaluation. The interface also asks a confirmation question via Yes/No radio buttons about viewing and attempting Assignment 1 at a provided link.

 Likewise the GAs also are available through the links in the seek portal as well as on the course domain shared above. 
 The course introduction has very important information. Many students who faced problems in Tools for Data Science in previous terms usually never read the intro. Please be diligent to read  everything carefully. 
 Don’t gloss over these bits (they are expandable if you click on them) for eg…

This course description highlights four key points: its exposure to practical, real-life tools; its challenging nature (described as "quite hard"); a pre-requisite of programming skills; and an emphasis on collaborative learning ("encourage learning by sharing").
