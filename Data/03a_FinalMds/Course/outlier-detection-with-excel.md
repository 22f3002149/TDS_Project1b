## Outlier Detection with Excel

[Outlier detection with Excel: "Here's a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image shows a screenshot of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet along with a video call window showing a person.\n\n**Excel Spreadsheet Details:**\n\n* **Content:** The spreadsheet is populated with numerical data in column A, ranging from row 816 to row 844.\n* **Formula:** In cell B1, a formula `=QUARTILE.EXC(A2:A844,4)` is visible. This suggests the spreadsheet is performing a quartile calculation on the data in column A.\n* **Formatting:** The spreadsheet cells are standard grid lines, with the formula bar visible above the data.\n* **Data Range:** The data appears to be a series of numbers, possibly statistical data or measurements.\n\n**Video Call Window:**\n\n* **Location:** A small video call window is visible in the top-right corner of the screen.\n* **Person:** It features a person with dark hair and a beard, wearing a blue shirt.\n* **Context:** The person appears to be participating in a video call, likely for work or a meeting.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n* **Operating System:** Based on the UI, the operating system appears to be Windows.\n* **Time:** There is a time indicator (35) visible at the bottom of the screen.\n* **Overall Context:** The image suggests someone is analyzing data in Excel during a video call."](https://youtu.be_sUTJb0F9eBw)

You'll learn how to identify and handle outliers in data using Excel, covering:

- **Understanding Outliers**: Definition of outliers and their impact on statistical analysis.
- **Calculating Quartiles**: Using Excel formulas to calculate Q1 (first quartile) and Q3 (third quartile).
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Finding the IQR by subtracting Q1 from Q3.
- **Determining Bounds**: Calculating lower and upper bounds using 1.5 times the IQR.
- **Identifying Outliers**: Using Excel functions to determine if data points fall outside the calculated bounds.
- **Visualizing Data**: Creating box plots to visualize outliers and data distribution.
- **Handling Outliers**: Deciding whether to exclude or keep outliers based on their impact on analysis.
