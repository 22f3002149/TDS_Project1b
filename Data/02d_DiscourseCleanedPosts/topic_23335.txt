@carlton I was trying to view a session, but since youtube is very distracting I tried to embed it on a site, but it throws this error

Website Where I am embedding
Video I am trying to watch
If possible, please fix this since the youtube as a platform is distracting and has many ads, even though the channel is not monitized.

I will have to get authorisation from the operations to allow embedding you tube videos. This was a deliberate choice as the content is strictly speaking owned by IITM. Embeddings may allow others to monetise content without the appropriate permissions.
I will enquire on your behalf. I accept that not every channel follows the directives properly, so you might find it possible to embed other channel videos from IITM, but I can only go by the agreed upon protocols.
I know that’s not much comfort, but if its possible, I will amend the permissions.
Kind regards
I purely understand that the content solely belongs to IITM and I truly adhere to it.

I can’t personally think of any way one can do this, but it’s completely upto to the operations team.
I ask for this permission as youtube can be quite distracting and getting rid of advertisements either require an adblocker that cause some trouble once in 2 weeks, even though they don’t turn of recommendations and hence the procrastination. Embedding is another way which can stop the recommendations and the advertisements.
Hope to hear soon,
Regards
