Microsoft Azure's academic verification tool requires users to confirm their educational status via email domain (currently not registered). If unable to verify this way, another method must be used, specifically by entering name, date of birth, and school details as per records. Communication is sent via the provided email address (`21MZ0470S@ds.study.itmu.ac.in`), confirming eligibility for Azure educational access privileges.
