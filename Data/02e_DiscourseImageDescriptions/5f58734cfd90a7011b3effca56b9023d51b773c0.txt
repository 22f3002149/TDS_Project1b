It\'s primarily text-based, showing commands, file paths, and progress indicators.\n\n**Key elements and details:**\n\n*   **Log Output:** The majority of the image consists of lines of text, representing the output of a build process. Each line contains a command or action being performed, along with a time estimate and/or file size information.\n*   **SHA256 Hashes:** Numerous lines begin with "sha256:", followed by a long hexadecimal string (a SHA256 hash). These identify specific layers or files being used in the build.\n*   **Commands:** Common Docker/build commands are visible, like "COPY", "RUN", "WORKDIR", "unpacking", and "building".\n*   **File Paths:** Paths like "/app", "/app/requirements.txt" are shown, indicating the location of files within the build context.\n*   **Progress Indicators:**  Numerical values (e.g., "3.51MB / 3.51MB," "0.0s") and time estimations ("0.1s," "5.1s") suggest the progress of file transfers and process execution.\n*   **Build Details:** A section is labeled "build details" displaying information about the build process. \n*   **Metadata:** Information like “Maintainer”, “Labels”, “Base image”, and "Exposed ports" are presented to describe the application.\n*   **Text color:** the color of the text is a dark green, while the numerical values are in white.\n\n**In summary,** the image provides a snapshot of a Docker build process. It details the steps taken to create an application image, including copying files, running commands (like installing requirements), and managing layers.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
