This split-screen graphic contrasts Bollywood actor Govinda's interview appearance (black jacket, orange shirt) with his face digitally altered onto an Avatar Na'vi character. The text "GOVINDA DECLINES 'AVATAR' FILM BY JAMES CAMERON" and sub-headline "(Claims he suggested the title)" highlight a news report about Govinda asserting he originally suggested the movie's name to Cameron, presented humorously through this visual combination.
