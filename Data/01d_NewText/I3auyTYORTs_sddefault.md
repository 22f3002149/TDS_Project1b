This Google Meet screenshot displays the main participant screen showing a dramatic Japanese-themed artwork of a samurai warrior wielding a katana, set against a dark background with a prominent red circle resembling the sun disc. The three participants are visible in their video grids (Radha, Akash V), although Amit Kumar Gu.. is presenting. A caution warns against sharing the entire screen to prevent an "infinity mirror" effect, and system tray indicators confirm it's running via Chrome browser on Windows.
