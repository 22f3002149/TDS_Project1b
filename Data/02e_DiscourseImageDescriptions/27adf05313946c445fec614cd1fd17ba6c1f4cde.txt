It is presented as a text-based screenshot of code.\n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n*   **Code Snippet 1: Storing Documents:**\n    *   The code iterates through a list named `documents`.\n    *   Inside the loop, it uses a function called `ollama.embed` with the model `mxbai-embed-large` to generate embeddings for each document.\n    *   The generated embeddings and the original document are then added to a collection using the `collection.add` function.\n    *   `ids` are assigned based on the index `i`.\n\n*   **Text "Step 2: Retrieve"**: Indicates a step in a larger process dealing with information retrieval.\n\n*   **Code Snippet 2: Retrieving Documents:**\n    *   Defines an example input query: "What animals are llamas related to?".\n    *   It generates an embedding for this input query, also using the `ollama.embed` function with the same model.\n    *   It then performs a query on the collection using `collection.query` to find documents similar to the input query, requesting only 1 result (`n_results=1`).\n    *   Finally, it assigns the most relevant document to the variable `data`.\n\n**Overall Context**: The image presents code demonstrating a basic implementation of a vector database for semantic search. It showcases how to store documents as embeddings and then retrieve the document most relevant to a given query.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
