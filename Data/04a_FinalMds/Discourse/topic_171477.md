This text-based evaluation report details failed prerequisites for TDS Project 1: Missing public GitHub repository access, no LICENSE file at the root with MIT license specified, and an absent/incorrect Dockerfile in the repository. These issues must be resolved before project evaluation proceeds.

This report evaluates a Docker container submission, highlighting that any missing required files instantly results in a zero score due to misconfiguration. Performance metrics indicate an expected 5-minute response time on specified hardware. Seven generated files with links are provided for the learner's detailed review of logs and scripts, acknowledging this is preliminary feedback before final grading updates occur.

 Good Morning Sir, 
 This is my github repo:  GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1 (https://github.com/kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1) GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1  ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.) 
 I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me.  Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.

Post:  Apologies for that, 
 The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation. 
 Kind regards

Post:  Hi  @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton , 
 I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails: 
 
 The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.) 
 The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository 
 
 Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:

This formal feedback email evaluates a student's Docker image submission for "Jan 25 Project 1." It explains evaluation criteria (response within 5 minutes), provides links to logs, scripts, and files, specifies the evaluated `b6d86ee6b17` image ID, and outlines troubleshooting steps with contact details (`tds.support@stud.itmo.ac.in`) for support.

Here's an analysis of the provided text:

The email screenshot details Project 1 prerequisite checks. Key requirements include public GitHub repository with MIT license and a valid Dockerfile accessible via dockerhub. The evaluation results show all prerequisites failed due to missing GitHub repo, absent Dockerfile, no license file, despite the docker image being present; hence, the score is zero.
 Second Evaluation Email Second Evaluation Email 1247×681 37.5 KB 
 My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components: 
 GitHub repo (https://github.com/23f2000345/TDS_final) GitHub repo 
 Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated. 
 Thank you for your time and assistance!

Post:  Hi, 
 Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Post:  Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir? 
 My GitHub repository for Project-1:  GitHub - sudhishssn134/project_1_tds (https://github.com/sudhishssn134/project_1_tds) GitHub - sudhishssn134/project_1_tds 
 Thanking You

This email evaluates a learner's submitted Docker image project ("Project 1 Scores"). It explains that 'MISSING' files indicate potential errors or misconfigurations in the Docker setup itself.

The evaluation requires the image to respond within ~5 minutes on specific server specs, impacting its score. Feedback and logs are provided via links, with contact details for support queries regarding the Docker project submission and assessment results.

Post:  Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error: 
 tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ()) 
 You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv.

Post:  Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below 
 Screenshot 2025-04-12 1153421466×702 50.4 KB (https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f58734cfd90a7011b3effca56b9023d51b773c0.png)

This log image depicts a Docker build process, displaying commands like COPY and RUN alongside layer identification via SHA256 hashes. It shows file paths (e.g., /app/requirements.txt), progress indicators using numbers and time estimates, and includes metadata sections detailing application information such as maintainer details, labels, base images, and exposed ports. The text appears in dark green against a likely light background.
