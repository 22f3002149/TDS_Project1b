This image is a Python error message in an interactive coding environment (like Jupyter). It shows a `NameError` because the variable 'location_id' used in line 35 to build a weather URL (`weather_url = f'https://www.bbc.com/weather/{location_id}'`) wasn't defined. The program was attempting to find Nur-Sultan's location ID, but failed due to this error.
