This image shows an SQLite database table fragment displaying customer bids for concert tickets with columns: 'type' (ticket category), 'units' (quantity bid), and 'price'. Sample data includes entries for bronze and silver tickets. Below the table, a question asks to write SQL code to calculate total sales specifically for "Gold" ticket type items.
