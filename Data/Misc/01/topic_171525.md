I submitted the form before the deadline with the API endpoint as /api, but I later realized the correct format was /api/ (with a trailing slash). To fix this, I edited the Google Form today.</p>
<p>Will this cause any issues with the submission? Please let me know if any further action is needed.</p>

Post: <p>It is not like that, it can be any endpoint, but whatever you submit should work. Like many frameworks treat /api/ and /api differently.</p>
<p>The project 2 docs assumes that the endpoint is /api/ and provides the code accordingly.</p>
