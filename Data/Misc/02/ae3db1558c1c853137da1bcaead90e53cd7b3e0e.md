Welcome! This tutorial guides you through downloading a JSON file (`vercel-python.json`) containing marks data for 100 students. You'll then create a Python API endpoint on Vercel, enabling CORS to accept GET requests from any origin searching by names 'X' and 'Y'. The expected response format is shown via code snippets (e.g., `"marks": [10, 20]`). Finally, use the provided example URL (`https://your-app.vercel.app/api`) to query your deployed API.
