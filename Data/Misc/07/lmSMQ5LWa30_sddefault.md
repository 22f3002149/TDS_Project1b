This image is a modern title card for a course or workshop session, using a dark navy/teal background with pastel illustrations for high contrast and readability. It prominently displays "WEEK 3" and "SESSION 1", suggesting progression tracking. Flat design icons around the text (like screens, circuits, and tools) hint at tech/design themes relevant to that week's content. The symmetrical layout features a patterned border around the central text area.
