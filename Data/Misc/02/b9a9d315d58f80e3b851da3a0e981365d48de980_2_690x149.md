This screenshot shows a minimalist Codespaces usage dashboard. A header displays "Codespaces" with a blue icon `<>`, noting quota reset after 13 days. The main sections show:

*   **Usage Hours:** 120/120 included core hours used, costing "$0.00".
*   **Storage:** 1.46 GB-months out of 15.00 included units utilized, also at zero cost.

Clear progress bars indicate resource consumption levels against the allocated budget.
