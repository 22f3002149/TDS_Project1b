Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited <img alt=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_166498/stuck_out_tongue.png" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" width="20"/>
Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important -  the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to @s.anand and the entire course team who designed this amazing course
I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_166498/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/>
