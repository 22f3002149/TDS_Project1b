This screenshot shows a **VS Code** editor displaying `lm.py` (commented as downloading/running from URL). The script targets `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runwayml/stable-diffusion-frontend/main/study.llm.ac.py`, uses `wget` to download it, and executes the downloaded file with argument "0". Terminal output confirms successful completion.
