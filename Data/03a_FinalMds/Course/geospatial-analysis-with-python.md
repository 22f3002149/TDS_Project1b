## Geospatial Analysis with Python

[Geospatial analysis with Python: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a computer screen displaying a geospatial analysis interface with a map of New Jersey and a video conference window.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Map:** A map of New Jersey is prominently displayed. The map has a light blue/green color scheme, with roads highlighted in magenta. A densely concentrated green area is focused over parts of Essex County, likely indicating a spatial analysis or data overlay.\n2. **Interface:** The map is embedded within a coding/analysis interface. Tabs labeled "File," "Edit," "View," "Insert," etc. are visible at the top. This suggests the user is performing data analysis or visualization.\n3. **Coding Environment:** The coding interface appears to be a Jupyter Notebook (indicated by the "Code" and "Text" tabs) running within a Google Colaboratory environment (evident from the URL in the browser address bar).\n4. **Video Conference:** In the bottom right corner, a small window shows a person in a video conference. The person is a man with short hair, wearing glasses. \n5. **Operating System:** The screenshot shows a Windows operating system interface at the bottom. \n6. **Status Bar:** A status bar shows task completion details with a timestamp, "completed at 10:38 PM".\n\n**Details**\n* The map shows major cities in New Jersey like Newark, Elizabeth, and Paterson.\n* The interface has a toolbar with icons for saving, running code, and inserting elements.\n* The video conference window shows an active speaker.\n\n**In essence, the image captures a data analyst engaged in geospatial analysis, possibly during a remote collaboration session.**](https://youtu.be_m_qayAJt-yE)

You'll learn how to perform geospatial analysis for location-based decision making, covering:

- **Distance Calculation**: Compute distances between various store locations and a reference point, such as the Empire State Building.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize store locations on a map using Python libraries like Folium.
- **Store Density Analysis**: Determine the number of stores within a specified radius.
- **Proximity Analysis**: Identify the closest and farthest stores from a specific location.
- **Decision Making**: Use geospatial data to assess whether opening a new store is feasible based on existing store distribution.
