This image shows text content primarily: a checklist warning about requirements for project submissions. The items list "No such repo", meaning no repository is present; "No 'MIT' in LICENSE", indicating an MIT license file should be included or might not meet criteria; and "No Dockerfile". Below this, there's an instructional message emphasizing that adherence to the checklist is necessary for any submission to even be considered for scoring.
