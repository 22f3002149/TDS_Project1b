This screenshot shows a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Vision AI project focused on chess piece data labeling. The interface displays tabs like 'Import' and 'Images', with primary functionality centered on labeling tasks using classes such as Bishop, King, Knight, Pawn, and Queen. An image grid hosts thumbnails awaiting labeling, while labels and counts are visible, aided by bottom-right pagination tools. A "www.paggal.com" watermark is present.
