# Docker Image Repository Interface

This image shows Jayesh Bansal's repository for his TDS project1 on a platform like Docker Hub (indicated by 'gemma3:27b'). Key elements include the last pushed date and size, tab navigation options ('General', etc.), tag details in a table showing name, digest (`sha256:a9a29a...`), OS/arch (`linux/amd64`), last pull time, compressed size (77 MB). A right sidebar displays Docker commands for pushing/pulling with copy functionality. The UI has flat design aesthetics and allows adding descriptions/categories or sorting/filtering tags.
