This image shows a user working through a CSS selector exercise on an online platform (like MDN). A challenge asks to find `<div>` elements with class "foo" and calculate the sum of their `data-value` attributes based on feedback from tools like 'CSS Diner'. The interface displays due dates, scores, error messages ('Incorrect. Try again.'), file lists ("Removed"), and ongoing tasks (process files).
