The background is black with green text indicating the progress and status of the build.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1.  **Command Line Prompt:**  The prompt shows the current directory: `PS C:\\projects\\tds_project>`.  It indicates that the user is running commands within a PowerShell environment.\n\n2.  **Docker Login & Build:**  Initial lines show a successful Docker login and the initiation of a build process using `docker build -t pratik087hala/automation-agent .`.\n\n3.  **Build Progress:** Lines show stages of the build process (e.g., transferring Dockerfile, pulling the base image).\n\n4.  **Error Message:** A prominent error message is displayed in red, indicating a failure to resolve the source metadata for the `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` base image.  The error cites a `http` request failure, specifically a failure to get from  `ps://docker-images-prod.goo8.azure.com/registry/v2/docker/library/python/3.12-slim-bookworm`. It also mentions an issue with the host.\n\n5. **Dockerfile Snippet:** The lower part of the image shows a snippet of the `Dockerfile`:\n   * Line 1: `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm` -  Specifies the base image for the Docker container.\n   * Line 3: `# Install essential system dependencies` - A comment describing the intent of the subsequent commands.\n\n6. **Build Details:** The final lines indicate the build details including the Docker version and the build context.\n\n**In essence, the image showcases a failed Docker build due to network or connection issues when attempting to pull the base Python image.**", thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
