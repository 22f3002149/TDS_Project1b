I submitted the form before the deadline with the API endpoint as /api, but I later realized the correct format was /api/ (with a trailing slash). To fix this, I edited the Google Form today. 
 Will this cause any issues with the submission? Please let me know if any further action is needed.

Post:  It is not like that, it can be any endpoint, but whatever you submit should work. Like many frameworks treat /api/ and /api differently. 
 The project 2 docs assumes that the endpoint is /api/ and provides the code accordingly.
