It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity" - This is a prompt asking for the API endpoint URL, providing an example.\n    *   "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity" - This is a URL entered as a response to the prompt.\n    *   "Error: Expected 3 matches" - This is an error message indicating that the system expected 3 matches but did not receive them.\n*   **Visual Elements:** The text is presented in white against a black background, typical of many developer tools. The entered URL has a slightly different style, possibly a text input field. A small error indicator (a circle with an \'i\' inside) is visible next to the entered URL.\n\nIn summary, the image displays an error message related to a CORS configuration and an expected number of matches, suggesting a problem with an API request.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
