Post: <p>Hello Sir,</p>
<p>I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.</p>
<p>Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards<br>
Shalini</p>

Post: <p>It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.</p>
<p>ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.</p>
<p>Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.<br>
The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.<br>
<em>The problem is the lack of time.</em></p>
<p>So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.</p>
<p>Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.</p>
<p>Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.</p>
<p>The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.<br>
But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

Post: <p>You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.<br>
I will also add the same in the student seek portal.<br>
Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!<br>
The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

Post: <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes.</p>

<p>No, we do not provide solutions as a notebook. The ROE will be solved during the live session.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks,<br>
also when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1 ta</p>
