This image shows a Microsoft academic verification form for an application. The title "Academic Verification" appears at the top. Fields include First Name (pre-filled as 'shashikumar'), Last Name (required), Country ('India' selected from dropdown), School Name (pre-filled with IIT Madras details), and Date of Birth (empty). A red error indicates that Last Name is required. The header notes an email domain issue, but the form proceeds if credentials are verifiable by school name.
