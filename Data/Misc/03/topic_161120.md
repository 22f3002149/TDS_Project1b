 Try adding CORS to your code it might work.

Post:  Hi Mishkat, 
 This error is because you are filtering on  class_  instead of  class 
 So if you send a request on  http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S  you will see response for that  1S  class only. 
 kind regards

Post:  Hi Guddu, 
 Inside  index.html  file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else. 
 This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

 Docker Desktop is  not free for organizations over 250 people (https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) not free for organizations over 250 people  and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

Post:  @22f2001640 (/u/22f2001640) @22f2001640  in that case 
 
 a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or 
 a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080 
 
 Please try one of these: 
 
 Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network 
 GitHub codespaces, as  @Jivraj (/u/jivraj) @Jivraj  suggested 
 
 You  could  try an ngrok alternative like  localtunnel (https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) localtunnel  but I don’t think that’ll work.

 What is the Docker image URL? It should look like:  https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general 
 
 If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps correctly?

Post:  Hi Mishkat, 
 The GA url encoded parameter is  class 
In your screenshot, you are using  class_ 
Your code that we examined earlier also accepts  class_  as the parameter instead of  class  as required by the GA 
The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter  class

Post:  Hi Mishkat, 
 In your code, the word  class  is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing  class_  to  class  is not going to work. The  only  thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api  not  the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem. 
 Kind regards

Post:  Hi Aindree, 
 I tried to send a request to your application  https://your-app2.vercel.app/api  with url encoded parameter  class=7Q . It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends  {"marks": []} . 
 Check if your csv file is correct.  Also check if code is correct. 
 Kind regards 
Jivraj

Post:  For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue

Post:  Hi Tushar, 
 For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running. 
 For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission. 
 Kind regards

i have added the header key in order to use the cors as said in the vercel doc but still i am getting that error. 
what to do? 
i have added the cors in the app.py file as well 
 from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
from flask_cors import CORS


app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# Load the data
with open("q-vercel-python.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)


@app.route("/api", methods=["GET"])
def get_marks():
    names = request.args.getlist("name")
    marks = [student["marks"] for student in data if student["name"] in names]
    return jsonify({"marks": marks})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

While I understand why you might choose to use  flask  due to your familiarity with it, 
the  http.server  library is just very simple to use. 
 The  only extra line of code  you would need inside your  get  request if you used the  http.server  library would be: 
 self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*") 
 Try to rewrite your code using  http.server   library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy. 
 The boilerplate code for a  get  request using the  http.server  library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm. 
 Kind regards

Post:  @23F300327 (/u/23f300327) @23F300327  You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine. 
 GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems. 
 Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly. 
 Also the live sessions on  youtube (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc) youtube  will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing. 
 There will be session  2025-01-20T14:30:00Z → 2025-01-20T16:30:00Z  which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries. 
 The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is  meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy (http://meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy) meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy

Post:  @23F300327 (/u/23f300327) @23F300327 
 Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. 
 When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api 
with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. 
 The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. 
 That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this 
 # api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return
 
 Notice there is no  if __name__ == "__main__":  code block. 
This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. 
 if __name__ == "__main__":  is used to execute some code  only  if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. 
 Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default  handler  class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. 
 Another possible problem: 
By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues  TDS > Development Tools > unicode (https://tds.s-anand.net/#/unicode) TDS > Development Tools > unicode 
 So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. 
 Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other. 
 Kind regards

Post:  I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a  vercel.json  configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code. 
 You can follow  Gui Bibeau’s guide (https://www.frontend-devops.com/blog/python-on-vercel) Gui Bibeau’s guide  to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM. 
 For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to  this guide on DEV Community (https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-vercel-2o5k) this guide on DEV Community . I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

Post:  From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are submitting in answer is not running. 
 For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to keep all the server’s running when you submit

Post:  Hi Naman, 
 error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a google search  Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is & How to Fix It) (https://www.lifewire.com/error-524-a-timeout-occurred-4782741) Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is & How to Fix It) . I tried submitting now while replying at 2:45 am it was working fine. 
 @s.anand (/u/s.anand) @s.anand  Is there any problem from our end, such as tds hosting server receiving lots of traffic on website.

 This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine. 
 Here is reference of error  ERR_NGROK_8012 | ngrok documentation (https://ngrok.com/docs/errors/err_ngrok_8012/) ERR_NGROK_8012 | ngrok documentation

Post:  @Jivraj (/u/jivraj) @Jivraj   Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image: 
 
 Open Squoosh and load the image 
 In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2). 
 The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes

 I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.

 Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. 
 That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”. 
 Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! 
 So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. 
 In the meanwhile:

 There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything. 
 Kind regards

Post:  Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again. 
 Can you clarify why this is happening?

Post:  because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong. 
 Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit. 
 The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks. 
 Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.” 
 Kind regards

Post:  hi  @23f2003853 (/u/23f2003853) @23f2003853 
 I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify  ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of  127.0.0.1 . Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.

Post:  Hello Sir, 
 I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.

Post:  Hi Shalini, 
 I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend. 
 Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel,  just check your code if it’s logically correct. 
 Kind regards

Post:  I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser. 
 In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)

Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

 This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it.

 Solution : 
 Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that.

Post:  The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using  127.0.0.1  and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with  http://localhost:8000/api  to see if it works. 
 If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the  ipconfig  command to check the correct IP address. 
 We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

Post:  Hi Srividya, 
 Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. 
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. 
 This renders  name == main  part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). 
 In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You  do not  create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. 
 This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. 
 Thanks for your input. 
 Kind regards

Post:  @ carlton @ Jivraj 
Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem. 
Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect. 
Do I need to do anything else ? 
Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved. 
Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.

Post:  In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with  --n-gpu-layers 35  parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that. 
 @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton   @Jivraj (/u/jivraj) @Jivraj  did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.

Post:  Try these  @21f3000745 (/u/21f3000745) @21f3000745 
 
 Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy. 
 If this doesn’t work, then: 
 Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work. 
 Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

 For the  ngrok tunnel  question and any other question requiring a server URL, make sure to  keep all servers running  when clicking the  Save  button. 
 Also, I couldn’t find the  GitHub Pages URL  in your  GA2 response , and many answers are unmarked. It seems you  didn’t click the Save button . 
 Your current score is  4.5/10 .

 For  Question 10 , ensure that  all servers are running  every time you submit (click the  Save  button). Since  ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs , double-check that the  ngrok URL is correct  before submitting. 
 For  Question 9 , did you  enable CORS ? To verify, check your  browser console —if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.

Post:  The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen. 
 If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list. 
 I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.
