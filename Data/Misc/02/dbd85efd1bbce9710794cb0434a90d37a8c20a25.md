This image shows a VS Code editor with Python code from `main.py` implementing a function (`handle_task_A2`) to check file existence and run Prettier formatting via subprocess. Below it, a terminal displays the original Markdown content (labeled "EXPECTED") followed by its unchanged result ("RESULT"), demonstrating that Prettier didn't modify this specific markdown example. The editor uses a dark theme with syntax highlighting.
