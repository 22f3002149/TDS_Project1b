It displays the output of several commands related to file hashing and formatting. \n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1.  **PowerShell Prompt:** The typical "PS C:\\Users\\kaiff>" prompt is visible, indicating the current directory in the file system.\n2.  **Commands:** Several commands have been executed:\n    *   `Get-FileHash -Path formatted.md -Algorithm SHA256`: This command calculates the SHA256 hash of the "formatted.md" file.\n    *   `npx -y prettier@4.2 "F:\\BS DATA SCIENCE\\Diploma Level\\1\\TDS\\README.md" > formatted.md`: This command uses the `prettier` code formatter to format the "README.md" file and save the result as "formatted.md".\n    *   `certutil -hashfile formatted.md SHA256`:  This command is used to calculate the SHA256 hash of the "formatted.md" file.\n3.  **Hash Output:**  The output of the hashing commands is displayed in a table-like format:\n    *   **Algorithm:** Shows "SHA256" indicating the hashing algorithm used.\n    *   **Hash:** Displays the SHA256 hash value, a long hexadecimal string.\n    *   **Path:** Shows the file path, "C:\\\\Users\\\\kaiff\\\\formatted.md."\n4.  **Text Output:** There\'s additional textual output indicating:\n    *   "SHA256 hash of formatted.md:" followed by the hash value.\n    *   "Certutil: -hashfile command completed successfully."\n\n**In summary,** the image demonstrates a workflow where a markdown file is formatted using `prettier`, and its hash is then calculated using PowerShell and `certutil` to verify its integrity or to confirm that the formatting process didn\'t alter the file content.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
