It presents two separate formula-based questions designed to test the user\'s knowledge of spreadsheet functions (specifically Google Sheets and Excel).\n\n**Top Question (Google Sheets):**\n\n*   **Heading:** "Let’s make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won\'t work in Excel)"\n*   **Formula:** `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAINT(SEQUENCE(100, 15, 6), 1, 10))`\n*   **Prompt:** "What is the result?"\n*   **Input field:** A blank text field is provided for the user to enter their answer.\n*   **Button:** A button labeled "Check" is located below the input field.\n\n**Bottom Question (Excel):**\n\n*   **Heading:** "Use Excel (0.25 marks)" with a small icon to the left. "Let\'s make sure you can write formulas in Excel. Type this formula into Excel."\n*   **Note:** “Note: This will ONLY work in Office 365.”\n*   **Formula:** `=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY( {3,14,6,10,3,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,4,14}, {10,9,3,12,2,11,8,16,14,7,5,4,6,1,3,12}), 1, 9))`\n*   **Prompt:** "What is the result?"\n*   **Input field:** A blank text field is provided for the user to enter their answer.\n*   **Note:** "Note: If you get #NAME? you have the wrong version of Excel. Find a friend for whom this works."\n*   **Button:** A button labeled "Check" is located below the input field.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n\n*   The interface has a dark background, typical of many web applications.\n*   The text is primarily white, providing strong contrast and readability.\n*   The questions are clearly separated and labeled.\n*   The buttons are a bright blue color.\n\n**In essence, the image is a screenshot of a practical exercise where the user is asked to input and evaluate spreadsheet formulas.**', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
