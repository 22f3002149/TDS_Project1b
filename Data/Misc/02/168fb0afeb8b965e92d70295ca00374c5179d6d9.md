This image captures a terminal session attempting to run and format a specific Markdown file (`/data/format.md`). Multiple HTTP requests (POST `run`, GET `read`) failed with 404 errors due to the file not being found. A server-side error (500) also occurred during processing, ultimately causing an AI reading failure for that missing file.
