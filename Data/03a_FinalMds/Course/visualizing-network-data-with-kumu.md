## Visualizing Network Data with Kumu

[Visualizing network data with Kumu: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a webpage displaying content related to "sparse matrix" on Wikipedia. It shows text explanations, code snippets, and mathematical matrices. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Webpage Content:** The primary focus is on the Wikipedia article about sparse matrices. The content includes definitions and explanations related to the compressed sparse row (CSR) format.\n2. **Matrices:**\n * A 4x4 example matrix with mostly zero values is displayed.\n * Another 4x4 matrix is shown towards the bottom, with numerical values (including 30, 60, 40, 80).\n3. **Code Snippets:** There are lines of code representing vectors and arrays (presumably in a language like Python or MATLAB) that are related to how the sparse matrix is represented in CSR format. Key arrays are:\n * `V = [5 8 3 6]`\n * `COL_INDEX = [0 1 2 1]`\n * `ROW_INDEX = [0 1 2 3 4]`\n4. **Textual Explanation:** There\'s text explaining concepts like how to extract rows from the matrix based on the `ROW_INDEX` and `COL_INDEX` arrays.\n5. **Browser Interface:** The image shows browser elements such as the address bar, tabs (including "Data-fortuna.xyz", "Korn", "Actor pairs and Actor networks", "Sparse matrix"), and browser buttons.\n6. **Person (Right Side):** A person with a beard is visible on the right side of the image, indicating this is likely a screenshot of a video or a live screen share during a presentation or tutorial. The person appears to be wearing a blue shirt.\n\n**In essence, the image captures a technical explanation of sparse matrices and the CSR format, likely presented in an educational context.**](https://youtu.be_OndB17bigkc)

[Network analysis â€“ filtering by year: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image shows a computer screen displaying a code editor interface with a tabular dataset, likely a data analysis workflow. A portion of the desktop and an initial or profile icon is also visible.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Code Editor:** The primary focus is a code editor window (likely VS Code based on the interface) with a file named "DataReport.Kumupyrda".\n2. **Data Table:** Within the editor, a data table is displayed. It has headers like "rowid", "sort", and "title". The table shows data like episode titles (e.g., "Episode #17", "Episode #19") and corresponding dates (e.g., "2012", "2014", "2012").\n3. **Code Snippets:** Below the table, there are snippets of code with the word "False" repeatedly appearing, suggesting a data filtering or boolean operation is being performed.\n4. **Interface Elements:** The editor features standard interface elements like a file explorer pane (left side) displaying file structure, and code editing tabs.\n5. **Desktop and Profile Icon:** The bottom right corner shows a circular profile icon with the letter "R", and the edge of desktop icons, suggesting the application window is not maximized.\n6. **System Tray:** The bottom right corner displays system tray icons (time, date, battery, and network).\n7. **Browser Tabs:** At the very top, we can see the edge of a web browser (likely Google Chrome) with numerous open tabs.\n\n**Context/Interpretation:** Based on the content, the image likely depicts a data analyst working with a dataset (possibly episode information) in a programming environment (Python, given the code snippets) for data cleaning, analysis, or reporting. The code is likely being used to filter or process this data.](https://youtu.be_oi4fDzqsCes)
