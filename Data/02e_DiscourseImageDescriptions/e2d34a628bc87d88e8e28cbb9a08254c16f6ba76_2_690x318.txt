The error indicates a connection issue between the ngrok agent and the upstream web service.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1.  **Header/Status Indicators:** A horizontal bar at the top shows four status indicators:\n    *   **Internet:** Green checkmark, indicating a stable internet connection.\n    *   **ngrok Edge:** Green checkmark, indicating the ngrok edge service is functioning.\n    *   **ngrok Agent:** Green checkmark, indicating the ngrok agent is running.\n    *   **Your Service:** Red \'X\', indicating a problem with the connection to the intended service.\n\n2.  **Error Message:** The central part of the image displays the error code "ERR_NGROK_8012." The message states that traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to connect to the upstream web service at `http://localhost:8080`. The specific error message "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused" suggests that no service is listening on that port locally.\n\n3.  **Troubleshooting Guidance (Developer):**\n    *   The image includes instructions for developers: "On the machine where the ngrok agent is running, make sure a web service is running on `http://localhost:8080`. Try to curl or open the address in a browser to see that you get the correct response.”\n    *   There\'s a link to documentation for help with this error.\n\n4.  **Troubleshooting Guidance (Visitor):**\n    *   The image provides instructions for visitors: “Wait a few minutes and refresh the page. If that still doesn’t work, please contact the developers of this page for more information.”\n\n**Overall Context:** The image is a screenshot of a webpage displaying an error message related to a failed connection between an ngrok tunnel and a locally running web service. It provides troubleshooting steps for both the developer running the service and a visitor accessing it through ngrok.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
