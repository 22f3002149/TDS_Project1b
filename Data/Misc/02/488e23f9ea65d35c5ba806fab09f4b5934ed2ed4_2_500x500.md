This document outlines specific deliverable tasks for an AI development project: create a GitHub repository with MIT license and tested code; build a Dockerfile and publish it publicly on Docker Hub; ensure the API endpoints function locally via Podman. Evaluation criteria are mentioned but not detailed here. Important notes include using the AIPROXY_TOKEN environment variable securely, keeping prompts short for `/run` calls to avoid exceeding time limits.
