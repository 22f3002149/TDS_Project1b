It\'s a dashboard showing the status and history of automated workflows.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1.  **Title:** "All workflows" is prominently displayed at the top.\n2.  **Subtitle:** "Showing runs from all workflows."\n3.  **Workflow Runs:** The image shows four workflow runs listed in chronological order (newest on top).\n4.  **Workflow Name:** Each run is labeled "Daily Commit Workflow."\n5.  **Run Details:** Each entry shows:\n    *   A numbered run (#1, #2, #3, #4).\n    *   A description like "Manually run by Anth205."\n    *   The branch the workflow ran on ("main").\n    *   The relative time ago the workflow ran (e.g., "5 minutes ago," "37 minutes ago," "54 minutes ago", "1 hour ago").\n    *   An icon representing the workflow run status (green checkmark indicates success, red "x" indicates failure).\n    *   An icon representing the type of event. \n    *   The duration of the run.\n    *   A "..." (ellipsis) menu to access more options.\n6.  **Search Bar:** A search bar labeled “Filter workflow runs” is located at the top right. \n7. **Column Headers:** The headings of the columns for each workflow run are labeled "Event", "Status", "Branch", and "Actor".\n\n**Color Scheme:** The interface is dark-themed, with white text for contrast. Green is used for successful workflow runs, and red for failed runs.\n\n**In essence, the image is a snapshot of a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) dashboard, showing the history and status of automated workflows related to a software project.**', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
