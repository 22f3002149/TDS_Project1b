Hi @carlton ,
Will this session be recorded and shared later?
It conflicts with live session of BA and that session is specially told that It will not be recorded.
@carlton sir, I too prefer a recording. I did not even attend the session due to personal work which I couldn"t avoid. Pls support
@kushabarodekar @Muthupalaniappan
As usual recording will be uploaded to youtube.
