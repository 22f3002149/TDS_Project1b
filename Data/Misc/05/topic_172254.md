 “Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.” 
So I did.  :man_tipping_hand: 
 
  (#p-617449-confession-my-labrador-did-all-my-assignments-1) :dog_face: :graduation_cap:   Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments   :books: :laptop: 
 Yes, I got  great marks  in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1. 
But let’s be real… 
 It was  my Labrador  who did the actual work  :service_dog: :brain: 
 While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was: 
 
 Solving  deployment issues  faster than my dev server boots 
 Writing  function calling code  like a true GPT whisperer 
 Fixing  LLM bugs  that I didn’t even understand 
 
 Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket. 
He growled at broken APIs. 
I took the credit.  :nail_polish: 
 
  (#p-617449-message-from-the-dog-developer-2) :loudspeaker:  Message from the Dog Developer: 
 
 “Thank you all for an awesome semester! 
I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning. 
But I am  personally offended  by one thing…” 
 
 
 “How dare you give  bonus marks on Week 7 ? 
I skipped it — just like many — because we were told  only best 4 of 7 would count . 
I demand justice. And a belly rub.” 
–  :dog_face: , Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist 
 
 
  (#p-617449-moral-of-the-story-3) :paw_prints:  Moral of the story: 
 Let your pets help with your coursework. 
You get the grade. They get the rage.

Post:  After fighting so much for GA, ROE, Project 1, and Project 2, my inner animal got hurt and fell asleep — and that’s how I ended up missing GA7. Please don’t hurt him any further.
