This markdown captures an interactive coding exercise displayed on a dark interface: "Use CSS selectors to find all `<div>`s having a `foo` class in the hidden element and calculate the sum of their `data-value` attributes." The presence of a red error icon and "Incorrect" text provides immediate feedback that no valid input has been entered.
