The background is black, and the text is white.\n\n**Specifics:**\n\n*   **File Paths:** The error message references two file paths: `"app/app.py"` and `"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/openai/__init__.py"`. This indicates an error occurred while running the script `app.py`, and the error originated from the OpenAI library.\n*   **Error Type:** The error is a `OpenAIError`. \n*   **Error Message:** The specific error message states, "The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable." This suggests the program is trying to use the OpenAI API, but an API key has not been provided.\n*   **Line Numbers:**  The error references specific line numbers within the files: line 35 in `app.py`, and line 109 in `openai/__init__.py`.\n*   **Code Snippet:** There is a code snippet `client = Openai(` with a series of seemingly irrelevant characters following it.\n*   **Context:** This error is common when working with the OpenAI API and indicates a missing or improperly configured API key.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the image captures an error encountered while running a Python program that uses the OpenAI API, indicating that an API key has not been set up correctly.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
