# Topic: Why Failed?

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Content:** The image is a screenshot of a text-based evaluation report, likely from an automated system. It details prerequisite checks for a "Project 1" submission, specifically relating to a GitHub repository and Docker image setup.\n\n**Key Sections & Points:**\n\n* **Introduction:** Begins with "Dear Learner," stating Project 1 requires passing prerequisite checks.\n* **Prerequisite List (Numbered 1-5):**\n 1. GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible\n 2. GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license\n 3. GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile\n 4. Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman run -e AIPROXY\\_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\\_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE\\_NAME\n 5. Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository.\n* **Warning:** It explicitly states submission will not be evaluated if these minimum requirements are not met.\n* **Evaluation Results:** Provides results for each check:\n * Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND public: PASS\n * Is Github repo present AND public: PASS\n * Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS\n * Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL\n* **Final Summary:**\n * Prerequisites: FAIL\n * Project 1 Score: 0\n\n**Overall Impression:** The report indicates that while the GitHub repository and Docker image setup are generally correct, the missing MIT license file at the root of the GitHub repository is causing the entire prerequisite check to fail.Screenshot 2025-04-03 1613021268×533 16.3 KB

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot from the GitHub documentation website, illustrating the process of adding a license to a repository. It\'s a step-by-step guide with highlighted sections and a code editor visible.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Browser Window:** Displays a webpage with a dark theme, specifically the GitHub Docs site.\n* **Navigation:** Top navigation shows the path: "Building Communities > Healthy Contributions > Add a license to a repo".\n* **Code Editor:** A prominent section showcasing a code editor interface where a file named "LICENSE" is being created. \n* **File Structure:** A file directory is shown on the left side, indicating a repository structure with folders like ".devcontainer" and ".github". \n* **GitHub Interface:** The interface elements are typical of GitHub with options like "Edit", "Preview", and a button labeled "Choose a license template".\n* **Instructions:** Numbered steps (3 and 4 are visible) guide the user on what to do, such as typing "LICENSE" or "LICENSE.md" and selecting a license template.\n* **Right Sidebar:** A sidebar titled "In this article" lists sections like "Including an open source license" and "Further reading".\n* **Visual Cues:** The image incorporates visual cues like highlighting and numbered instructions to guide the user through the process.\n\n**In essence, the image is a tutorial screenshot demonstrating how to add a license file to a GitHub repository.**image1480×950 140 KB
I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as Licenese.md but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).
So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?
@Jivraj please reply
Here is a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a series of commit logs, likely from a version control system like Git (possibly GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). The logs show a history of changes made to a project, specifically related to a license file.\n\n**Specific Details:**\n\n1. **Commit Logs:** There are four visible commit logs. Each log provides information about a specific change made to the project.\n2. **Dates:**\n * April 3, 2025: "Rename License.md to LICENSE.md"\n * February 17, 2025: "Update License.md"\n * February 15, 2025: "Update and rename README.md to License.md"\n * (Older commit) "project"\n3. **Author:** All commits listed are authored by "viraptale".\n4. **Status:** Each commit is marked as "Verified" with a green checkmark.\n5. **Commit Hashes:** Each commit also displays a unique alphanumeric hash code, which is used to identify the commit.\n6. **Icons:** Icons are present next to each commit, indicating actions like file changes or potentially code reviews.\n\n**In essence, the image showcases a commit history focused on updating and renaming a license file within a software project.**Screenshot 2025-04-07 1742561710×518 33 KB
I submitted the project within the deadline, and I ensured that all requirements were fulfilled, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.
However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.
Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1
I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.
Thank you for your understanding.
