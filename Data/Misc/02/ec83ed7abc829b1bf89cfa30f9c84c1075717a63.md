This image depicts a markdown-formatted table detailing image metadata. The three columns are **Last Pushed**, **Contains**, and **Visibility**. Two rows show data: one entry was pushed about 2 hours ago containing an *IMAGE*, marked with red circles as *Public*; another, from two months ago, also contains an *IMAGE* and is likewise shown as *Public*.
