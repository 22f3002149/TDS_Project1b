You'll learn data aggregation and visualization techniques in Excel, covering:

- **Data Cleanup**: Remove empty columns and rows with missing values.
- **Creating Excel Tables**: Convert raw data into tables for easier manipulation and formula application.
- **Date Manipulation**: Extract week, month, and year from date columns using Excel functions (WEEKNUM, TEXT).
- **Color Scales**: Apply color scales to visualize clusters and trends in data over time.
- **Pivot Tables**: Create pivot tables to aggregate data by location and date, summarizing values weekly and monthly.
- **Sparklines**: Use sparklines to visualize trends within pivot tables, making data patterns more apparent.
- **Data Bars**: Implement data bars for graphical illustrations of numerical columns, showing trends and waves.
