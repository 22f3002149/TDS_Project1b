This image shows a Google Colab notebook titled "COVIDForecasting.ipynb". It features a line graph displaying data from February to July 2021. Two green and purple rolling mean lines compare weekly trends over different periods (15 vs 20 days). Below the graph, Python code snippets are visible, demonstrating calculations of various rolling means, display of dataset head information, setting inplace mode, plotting autocorrelation functions using statsmodels, and data analysis for COVID forecasting.
