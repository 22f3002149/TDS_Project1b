This screenshot shows the output of a Python script running in Google Colab, named bbc-weather-scraping.ipynb.

The code displays JSON formatted weather data as dictionaries with keys: "Date", "High" (temperature), "Low" (temperature), and "Summary". Sample entries include summaries like 'Sunny intervals' or 'Light snow', showing scraped information for multiple days.
