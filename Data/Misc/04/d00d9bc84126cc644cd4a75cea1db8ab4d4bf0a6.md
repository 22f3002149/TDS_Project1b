This screenshot captures an online exam interface experiencing technical difficulties. Despite displaying 'No recent saves' in its header and attempting to load questions via a spinner, the system encounters an error. A prominent red box shows "Error!" with the specific message: "Sorry, we couldn’t load the questions. That’s strange." Below it is another technical error stating "cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘1’)" likely related to JSON parsing or data access issues during API calls. The interface prompts users to contact the exam team and includes a 'Check all' button alongside other controls against this backdrop.
