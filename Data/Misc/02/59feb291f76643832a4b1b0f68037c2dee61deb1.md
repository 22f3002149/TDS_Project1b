This image shows a Python traceback error, specifically a `KeyError: 'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'`. The error occurs at `/app/app.py`, line 30, when code tries to access the environment variable via `os.environ['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']` but it is not defined. The error also points to the `_getitem_` function in the frozen `os` module (frozenos) as called during this key access attempt.
