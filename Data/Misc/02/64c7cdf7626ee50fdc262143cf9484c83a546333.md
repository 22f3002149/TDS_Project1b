This image shows a Git commit history visualization likely from Visual Studio Code.

It displays branching structure with colored dots possibly indicating authors or commit types, including specific messages like "Aishik signing off" or "Add link".

The primary branch is marked as "main", and circular shapes around some commits signify merges. A top banner reads "SOURCE CONTROL". This graph provides a clear historical overview of code development activities using branching-and-merging structure.
