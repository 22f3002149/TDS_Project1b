This image shows Python code interacting with the OpenAI chat completions API (specifically gpt-4-turbo). It sets up the endpoint URL and headers using an API key placeholder. The code prepares a payload containing user messages, sends it via a POST request, checks for success, processes the response JSON to retrieve generated text and token usage information.
