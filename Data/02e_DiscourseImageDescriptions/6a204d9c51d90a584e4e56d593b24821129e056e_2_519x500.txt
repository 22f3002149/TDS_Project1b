It appears to be a debugging output from a software application.\n\n**Specific Elements & Messages:**\n\n1.  **Task Initiation:** The first line indicates a task is running: "Running task: Format `/data/format.md` with `prettier@3.4.2` in-place."\n\n2.  **HTTP POST Request:**\n    *   It shows an HTTP POST request to `http://localhost:8365/run?` with parameters related to the formatting task.\n    *   The request returns an "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error."\n\n3.  **Error Details (JSON format):**\n    *   The `details` field reports "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts: Error code: 401."\n    *   The error message within the `error` field says, "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer."\n    *   It specifies the error type as "invalid\\_request\\_error".\n\n4.  **HTTP GET Request:**  An attempt to read the file `/data/format.md` through an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8365/read?` resulted in an "HTTP 400 Bad Request".\n\n5.  **A2 Failed Message:** The message “A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md” appears after the failed GET request.\n\n6.  **Visual Indicators:** \n    *   A red circle with a white dot indicates the task is running.\n    *   A red "X" symbol signifies that the task has failed.\n\n**Context & Interpretation:**  The application tried to format a Markdown file (`/data/format.md`) using `prettier`, but it encountered issues. First, the task failed due to an authentication problem with the LLM (Large Language Model) service, receiving a 401 error. Later, attempting to read the same file failed with a 400 error, which likely stems from the initial authentication failure or file access permissions.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
