This document details a case study for **ReceiptRevive Analytics**, focusing on recovering sales data from digitized receipts despite OCR errors causing incomplete or truncated JSON. The client **RetailFlow Inc** needs historical analysis. Key missing fields include `id`, but focus is needed for the `sales` values, as analysts must parse JSON files and calculate total sales across rows, with benefits including informed business decisions. A download link to a supporting script is provided: [from g-parse-partial-json.py](https://github.com/).
