The text is presented as a bulleted list with some code snippets and URLs.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n*   **Heading 1: Deliverables** – This section outlines tasks to be completed.\n    *   Create a new Github repository.\n    *   Add an MIT License file.\n    *   Write and test your code. It includes instructions to use `POST /run?task=...` and `GET /read?path=...`.\n    *   Commit and push the code.\n    *   Create a Dockerfile that builds your application.\n    *   Publish your Docker image publicly to Docker Hub.\n    *   Ensure that running your image via `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000` serves the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`.\n    *   Submit a Google Form with the Github repository URL (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and Docker image URL (`user-name/repo-name`).\n*   **Note:** This section contains important reminders.\n    *   Use the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable for security.\n    *   Use your AI Proxy token, which has a $1 limit.\n    *   Stick to GPT-4o-Mini as the generation model.\n    *   Keep prompts short for the `/run` and `/read` calls to complete within 20 seconds.\n*   **Heading 2: Evaluation** – This suggests there's a section below (not fully visible) detailing how the deliverables will be assessed.\n\n**Text Style & Formatting:** The text is in a clear, instructional style, with code snippets, URLs, and bullet points to enhance readability.
