This image shows Python code calculating distances between communities (OakParkTown, EastSpringsSettlement, etc.) and a CentralCommandPostLocation using the Haversine formula for great-circle distance. It then sorts these locations by ascending distance to determine an optimal evacuation sequence based on proximity, printing each community with its calculated km value.
