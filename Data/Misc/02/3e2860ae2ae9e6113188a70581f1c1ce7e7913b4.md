This image shows a webpage for an educational exercise on converting PDF files (specifically `pdf-to-markdown.pdf`) to Markdown format using Prettier v3.4.2. It displays instructions, benefits like improved accessibility and productivity, sample output code (`# Suggero comes denique argentum...`), formatting steps, and an error message at the bottom: "It is hard to get the correct Markdown output from a PDF".
