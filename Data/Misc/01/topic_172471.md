Post: <p>I had been accidentally given a duplicate peer and assigned a new peer on 10th April with the evaluation deadline being 11th April 11:59 PM. I had asked for access to the Google Sheet for question 1 however I have not been given any access and the deadline is up. What to do?</p>

Post: <p>Yes sir, but therein lies the problem, this extra peer (atleast for me) did not give me access to his Google Sheets and now the deadline is over and I could not submit a blank Google form.</p>
