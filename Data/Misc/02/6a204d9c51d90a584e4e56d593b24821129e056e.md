**Overall Impression:** This CLI screenshot shows an error during task execution: formatting `/data/format.md` with `prettier@3.4.2`. An HTTP POST request to `http://localhost:8365/run?` failed (HTTP 500), then a subsequent LLM service call returned a 401 ('invalid issuer'), causing the task failure and displaying an 'A2 failed' message.
