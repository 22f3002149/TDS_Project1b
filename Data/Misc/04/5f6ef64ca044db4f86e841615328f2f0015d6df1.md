This image shows a failed execution of `app.py`. The terminal logs indicate an HTTP request to `http://localhost:8000/predict` resulted in a 400 Bad Request error. The server requires an 'image' field be sent, which was likely absent or incorrectly formatted in the request payload, causing the script failure after two attempts.
