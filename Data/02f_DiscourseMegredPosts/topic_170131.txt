# Topic: Problem with TDS GA Scores

In every TDS assignment after the first, I have not seen a submit button in the assignment page so I could not submit it there( I see it in the sanand portal and submit it there)
Now, my assignment score for all assignments (2,3,4,5) shows 0
I am attaching SS of my assignment-5 page to show there was no submit button available there
I had raised this as a ticket in the Support desk(21/Feb) in the past as discourse was not available to me at that time, but this didn’t get resolved. I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a web page displaying a "Graded Assignment" page within an online learning platform. It appears to be a course page with a side navigation menu and a main content area detailing assignment submission information and troubleshooting steps.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1. **Web Browser:** The screenshot is taken within a web browser (likely Chrome), as evidenced by the address bar, tabs, and browser controls.\n2. **Webpage URL:** The URL visible in the address bar is "se2022.itrm.ac.in", suggesting this is an online learning portal associated with the "IT Madras" institution, as indicated by the logo at the top-left.\n3. **Side Navigation Menu:**\n * It includes options such as "Modules", "Grades", and “Learning Feedback”\n * Listed modules include "Module 2: Deployment Tools", "Module 3: Large Language Models", "Project 1", "Module 4: Data Sourcing", and "Module 5: Data Preparation”.\n * "Graded Assignment 5" is highlighted in the module list.\n4. **Main Content Area:**\n * **Heading:** “Graded Assignment”\n * **Due Date:** "2023-02-21, 23:59 IST" is displayed.\n * **Submission Info:** A message informs the user they can submit the assignment multiple times before the deadline.\n * **Troubleshooting:** A series of bullet points list potential issues and solutions for accessing the assignment (e.g., disabling ad blockers, ensuring JavaScript is enabled, using Chrome).\n * **Student ID Required:** The page explicitly states that the student must use their student ID to complete the assignment.\n * **Link to Assignment:** A link is provided to access "Graded Assignment 5" which takes to “https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2023-01-ga5”.\n\n**Overall Purpose:** The image displays a typical online learning environment where students can access assignments, understand submission guidelines, and troubleshoot potential technical issues.SS1895×1010 167 KB
@22f3001561 GA5 like all the prior GAs for TDS Jan 25 term were all to be submitted through the graded assignment page. Which is in the link provided (it is actually in the screen shot you have provided).
All the previous GA 1 through 4 were also exactly the same.
We have no evidence you ever submitted any of the other GAs except GA1.
Kind regards
