This image shows an evaluation result from a conversation interface regarding Project 1 prerequisites. Although the Docker setup passed ("Is Docker image present...: PASS"), most requirements failed â€“ notably missing public GitHub repository access, absence of MIT license and Dockerfile files at the root level. Consequently, prerequisite checks overall were "FAIL", leading to a zero project score due to incomplete submission criteria being met.
