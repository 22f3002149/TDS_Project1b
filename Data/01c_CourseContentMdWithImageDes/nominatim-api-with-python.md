## Nominatim API with Python

[Nominatim Open Street Map with Python: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a slide, likely from a presentation or online course, with a light, neutral background. It features text detailing the topic and instructors.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Title:** "Get the data: Nominatim â€“ Open Street Maps" is prominently displayed in large, dark text.\n* **Course Title:** "Course: TOOLS IN DATA SCIENCE" is positioned below the main title, in a slightly smaller font size.\n* **Instructor Information:**\n * "INSTRUCTOR - ANAND S"\n * "Tutorial Instructor - MAHESH BALAN U" are indicated below the course title.\n* **Branding:** The "IIT Madras Online Degree" logo is present in the upper right corner.\n* **Color Scheme:** The slide uses a muted color palette - light gray/beige for the background, dark gray/black for the text, and a blue strip at the very bottom.\n\n**Overall, the image conveys information about a data science course module focused on Nominatim and Open Street Maps, with details about the instructors involved.**](https://youtu.be_f0PZ-pphAXE)

You'll learn how to get the latitude and longitude of any city from the Nominatim API.

- **Introduction to Nominatim**: Understand how Nominatim, from OpenStreetMap, works similarly to Google Maps for geocoding.
- **Installation and Import**: Learn to install and import [geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/) and [nominatim](https://nominatim.org/).
- **Using the Locator**: Create a locator object using Nominatim and set up a user agent.
- **Geocoding an Address**: Use `locator.geocode` to input an address (e.g., Eiffel Tower) and fetch geocoded data.
- **Extracting Data**: Access detailed information like latitude, longitude, bounding box, and accurate address from the JSON response.
- **Classifying Locations**: Identify the type of place (e.g., tourism, university) using the response data.
- **Practical Example**: Geocode "IIT Madras" and retrieve its full address, type (university), and other relevant information.
