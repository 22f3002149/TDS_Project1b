# Topic: LLM what rocket science going on here

The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.
@carlton sir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .
Hi Hari,
The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.
Have you watched this session in particular?

Here is a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image appears to be a graphic or a slide title card with a stylized, geometric design. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Text:** Large, bold text reads "WEEK 3 SESSION 1" centered on the image. "WEEK 3" is in a lighter shade of green/teal, while "SESSION 1" is a brighter, warmer shade of green.\n* **Geometric Design:** The image is layered with a repetitive pattern of colorful, flat geometric shapes and icons. These include circles, squares, triangles, lines, and various abstract icons reminiscent of circuitry, technology, or data visualization.\n* **Color Palette:** The image uses a bright and modern color scheme that incorporates shades of teal, orange, red, and white.\n* **Composition:** The design is organized into horizontal bands. Thereâ€™s a band of geometric patterns at the top, a darker central section with the text, and another band of geometric patterns at the bottom.\n* **Background:** The background is a deep navy blue with lighter blue areas on the sides.\n\n**Style:** The overall style is flat design, with simple shapes and a limited color palette. It has a modern and tech-focused aesthetic.\n\n**In essence, this image is a visually appealing title card likely used for a presentation or online course module referencing "Week 3, Session 1."**


If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a computer desktop showing a web browser window filled with numerous open tabs. The browser appears to be Google Chrome. A dark vertical bar is visible on the right side of the screen.\n\n**Browser Window Details:**\n\n* **Tabs:** A large number of browser tabs are open, displaying titles related to:\n * Various AI models and large language models.\n * Data science tools and resources.\n * Documentation and project details.\n * Specific dates (e.g., "13 June 2024").\n * Learning materials like tutorials.\n * A project titled "Prime Number Project."\n* **Browser UI:** Standard Chrome interface elements are visible including the address bar, refresh/back buttons, and tab controls.\n\n**Desktop Elements:**\n\n* **Background:** An abstract, colorful background appears to be a cartoon/animated design with various characters.\n* **Taskbar:** The Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom of the screen. \n* **Dark Vertical Bar:** A dark-colored, rectangular bar is visible on the right side, with a circular icon at the bottom and text indicating "Amit Kumar Gupta". \n\n**Other Notes:**\n\n* The large number of open tabs suggests the user is actively researching, learning, or working on a data science/AI-related project.\n* The overall aesthetic is somewhat chaotic due to the density of open tabs and the colorful background.\n* Date on the bottom right corner is "11-07-2024".


followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a web browser window displaying an online course interface alongside a video call. It appears to be a screen recording of a data analysis learning session.\n\n**Browser Window (Left Side):**\n\n* **Website:** The browser displays a course page from "seek.ondigitallearning.com" within a module titled "Data Sourcing".\n* **Course Navigation:** A sidebar lists course modules including "Course Introduction", "Self Assessment", "Data Discovery", "Data Sourcing" (currently selected), "Data Preparation", "Data Analysis", and "Large Language Models".\n* **Module Content:** The main content area displays information on "Data Sourcing", including a 5-star rating, a "Submit Review" button, and a list of links and references such as "PDF Scraping - Notebook" and "Learn about the pandas package - Video".\n* **Optional Section:** There is a section describing a "Real-life scraping" example with an image of the website "strawhat.com.au" being scraped.\n\n**Video Call (Right Side):**\n\n* **Video Feed:** A video call window is visible, showing a person named "Carlton D\'Silva" with a blurred background of an office or interior space.\n* **Participants:** A row of small video feeds showing multiple participants in the video call is visible at the bottom.\n\n**Other elements:**\n\n* Browser tabs are visible at the top, indicating multiple open windows or applications.\n* A timestamp indicating the current time is visible in the top right corner.\n* The overall composition suggests a remote learning session where a user is following along with course material while participating in a live video discussion.


But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.
Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.
Kind regards
