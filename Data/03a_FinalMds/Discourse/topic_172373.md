# Topic: PYQ doubt

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a multiple-choice question related to identifying if a timestamp corresponds to Saturday using Python\'s `datetime` library.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Question Header:** "Question Number : 307 Question Id : 6406531045319 Question Type : MCQ Correct Marks : 1 Question Label : Multiple Choice Question". This indicates a multiple-choice question with assigned identifiers and scoring.\n* **Question Text:** "Which of the following methods is best for identifying if a log entry\'s timestamp corresponds to Saturday? (timestamp is a method in datetime library)". This is the question being posed.\n* **Options:** The image presents four answer options, each preceded by a unique ID:\n * 6406533529040: "Check if timestamp.weekday() == 5" (marked with a red \'X\', suggesting it\'s incorrect)\n * 6406533529041: "Check if timestamp.weekday() == 6" (marked with a green checkmark, indicating it\'s correct)\n * 6406533529042: "Check if timestamp.strftime(\'%A\') == \'Saturday\'" (marked with a red \'X\', suggesting it\'s incorrect)\n * 6406533529043: "Check if timestamp.dayname() == \'Saturday\'" (marked with a red \'X\', suggesting it\'s incorrect)\n\n**Visual Details:**\n\n* The question and options are presented in a standard question-and-answer format, likely extracted from an online learning platform or assessment tool.\n* Each answer option has an indicator symbol (red \'X\' or green checkmark) to denote correctness.\n* The image appears to be a screenshot of a digital interface.\n\n\n\nimage1141Ã—678 102 KB
