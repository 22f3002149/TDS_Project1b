This image depicts a Linux shell session where user "sarva" executes commands in their "/downloads" directory. The command uses `npx` and the specified version of Prettier (`@3.4.2`) to format **README.md**, then pipes the output through sha256sum to compute its checksum, displayed as a hexadecimal string. Text colors enhance readability.
