The lines vary in height, depicting the amplitude of the audio signal.\n*   **Color Scheme:** The waveform is rendered in shades of gray or white against a solid black background. This high-contrast color scheme enhances the visibility of the waveform.\n*   **Horizontal Orientation:** The waveform extends horizontally across the entire image frame, suggesting a continuous audio segment.\n*   **Overall Impression:** The image conveys a sense of sound, audio frequency, or signal processing, often associated with music, voice recording, or audio editing.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the image is a graphic depiction of sound as a visual waveform.", thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
