This image depicts a Python application deployed on Vercel attempting to fetch data from its API during debugging. Instructions show fetching marks via `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`, but a specific URL (`https://a-vercel-app-mvqtz29-sr-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api`) results in an error ("TypeError: Failed to fetch"). The setup highlights enabling CORS as necessary.
