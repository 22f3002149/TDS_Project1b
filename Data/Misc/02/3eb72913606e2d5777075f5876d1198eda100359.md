This image depicts a web application screenshot showing an interface for submitting questions via a form titled 'Submit Your Question'. A prominent text input field allows users to enter their query, while an optional ZIP file upload section provides "No file chosen" feedback. The large blue 'Submit' button finalizes the action. The background is light-gray and centered within a browser window navigating `tdproject2.vercel.app/qfp/`. The design aims for minimalism in handling question submissions with potential file attachments.
