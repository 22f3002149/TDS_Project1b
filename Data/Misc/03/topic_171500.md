Post:  Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer reviews are done. 
(roughly 3 days before end term). 
 Kind regards

 What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We can’t leave it blank.

Post:  Hi  @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton  sir, 
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email. 
 Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?
