This image depicts a laptop screen showing an active GitHub development environment. The repository "my-repo" belongs to Sakshi6749 and displays files including ".github/workflows", READMEs, recent commits (last 31 minutes ago with message "third time"), and standard interface elements like Code tabs, commit details, and action buttons (fork/star). Judging by the taskbar icons, it's an ASUS Zenbook running Windows.
