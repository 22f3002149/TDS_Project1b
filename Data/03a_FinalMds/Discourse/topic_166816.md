kindly check on this sir.
Could you send me your email id. thanks.
Hi, the same issue persists for me for GA 2 and 4. I also did not attemp GA 3. Please look into this. My email id: 24ds3000061@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
My Graded assignment results are also not appearing in the dashboard. My email id is 22f2001532@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
@24ds3000061 @22f2001532
Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.
GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.
Kind regards
Thanks Carlton. Now the results are visible in the dashboard.
Thanks

Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem.
(Its a data cleaning and packaging issue - a typical TDS problem )
Okay sir, no worries then. Thank you for the explanation.
I have completed and checked and even saved the assignment for GA2 and GA3, however it says that I was absent for both GA2 and GA3.
Please check my assignment and ensure that it has been corrected, since I have checked the website and I had submitted.
Thank you
Mine too but only for GA2. I have submitted and ensured it was checked and saved the assignment on Ex website but it shows that I was absent.
@23f2005283 @23f1002223
Can you check your dashboard (not your seek portal, dashboard is where all your course cards are visible). I have been informed by Operations that the scores have been pushed for week 1 to week 4 (including the bonus mark for discourse post in week 4)

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.
Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.
The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.
Kind regards.
Sir for the GA3 the saved score says its 4.5, total is 9.5 so my total should be 47.4.

I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.
@shubham6 I have checked the backend server. It does show your score as 8 for GA2, so we have the correct score for you.
Can you send me a screenshot of your dashboard (where your course cards are) thanks.
