This Google Colab screenshot shows a Python script analyzing an uploaded image named 'lenna.webp'. The code imports libraries like numpy, PIL, colab files, and colorsys. It opens the image file into a NumPy array, calculates lightness for each pixel (using `colorsys.rgb_to_hls`), and counts how many pixels have a lightness value exceeding 0.219, resulting in an output of approximately **248,985** bright pixels.
