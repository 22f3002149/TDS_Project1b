This image depicts a GitHub Actions dashboard listing recent workflow runs for a project's "Daily Commit Workflow". Each entry shows the run number (#1-#4), duration, branch (main), event type icon, success/failure status via green/checkmark or red/x icons, and an ellipsis menu. A search bar allows filtering these runs.
