This text outlines university policy for repeating courses ("Improvement Courses") to enhance understanding, available only for grades A-E and capped at a 'CCC Limit'. Key points include: official transcripts reflect the highest grade achieved; students are strongly advised against repetition unless absolutely necessary. Repeated courses incur double fees but offer flexible registration levels. All course materials remain accessible regardless of repetition status.
