This image shows a terminal displaying an error traceback from Python code attempting to process an image (like credit card data). The core issue is an `OSError: cannot open resource`, specifically related to opening font files such as "arial.ttf" or "DejaVuSans.ttf". This suggests problems loading fonts using the Pillow library's `ImageFont` module, even after recent package installation. File paths like `/root/.cache/uv/environments-v2/ffad5b5c0487eb6/lib/python3.13/site-packages/PIL/ImageFont.py` are visible.
