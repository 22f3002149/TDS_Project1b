Here's a concise markdown description of the Docker terminal output:

This screenshot shows two commands: `docker pull --platform arm64 rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3` pulling an image for ARM64 architecture, and verification via `docker images | grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"`. The output confirms a successful download with digest `sha256:bd2d0e879ec6b...`, displays the image ID (`466630e32b8`), its creation time, size (approx. 581MB), and tag `v3`.
