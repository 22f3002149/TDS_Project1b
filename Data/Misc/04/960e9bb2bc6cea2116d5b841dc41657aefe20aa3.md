A dark-themed development screen shows instructions for querying an API endpoint with a 'class' parameter, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/class/1A. It reminds the user to enable CORS and suggests validating responses. A blue loading bar indicates progress, while a red error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" appears, suggesting the request failed due to CORS or an endpoint issue.
