This image shows a terminal session where a user attempted to install NumPy via pip in their Python environment.

Initially encountering an "externally managed" error, they followed instructions suggesting package managers or virtual environments for system-wide installs.

A command attempts to activate a specific virtual environment at `/home/jafreep/python3/venv/`.

Despite this context, the `pip install numpy` command succeeds because NumPy (version 1.23.2) was already installed in their site-packages directory.

The session ends with a prompt for further commands (`jafreeparcilaux >`).
