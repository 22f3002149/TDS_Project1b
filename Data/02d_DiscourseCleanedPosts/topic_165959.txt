what is the error here?? sir @Jivraj
I have the Same doubt.
@22f3001315 @21f3002277 @24ds2000024 – please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this:
Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4

FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.
In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?
edit:  This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?
@23f2000237 A good point. Yes, please include all titles. I’ve reworded the question accordingly. Thanks.

I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10?
(Assuming they have interacted in this thread)
Anyone scoring 10/10 on GA4 and replying with a relevant message on this thread will get 11/10 <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_165959/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/>
For me I just made filter of rating between 2 and 7 in site and typed in console as per  video. with that data got in console worked fine.
copy the coding and save in place use it for data extract when finally submit

how to get the BBC weather API key?
Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.
Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?
@JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.
you can go and login using your email id in this below mentioned link
https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
Error: At [10].year: Values don’t match. Expected: "2025– ". Actual: “2025–”

@Jivraj can help me to fix the issue
Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository)
Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any error

@Jivraj @carlton
Hi Tushar,
If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.
kind regards

Set up Git user (23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in)


Still the same error appears
Thanks for providing clarification Sir
I am also facing same issue can’t resolve.
@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini
In ques 4 Scrap the BBC Weather API,
I scraped the locationId for my city (i.e Mumbai)
and post that also mapped each issueDate to its corresponding enhancedWeatherDescription .
The sample output mentioned was:
The output would look like this:
{
  "2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds",
  "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
  "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies",
  // ... additional days
}

And My Output after scraping (And as explained by professor in Video 2 BBC weather was)
{
“2025-02-05”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-06”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-07”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-08”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-09”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-10”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-11”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-12”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-13”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-14”: “A clear sky and light winds”,

“2025-02-18”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-19”: “A clear sky and light winds”
}
But it’s giving Error::
Error: At root: Different number of properties
Can you please help how to fix this issue.
Issue resolved for me after following below step
After creating the workflow:

Trigger the workflow and wait for it to complete
Ensure it appears as the most recent action in your repository
Verify that it creates a commit during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run

In place of “name: Setup up GIT config” change to “name: add commit {your_email}”
use this Google Colab with the city name to get the Json Body just change the date format.

Also what does this " It is very hard to get the correct Markdown output from a PDF. Any method you use will likely require manual corrections. Reformatting with Prettier helps standardize the output format for comparison." mean.

In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown content but it was incorrect all the time.
I have tried these steps:
import pymupdf4llm
md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")

import pathlib
pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())

Then i run this in bash
prettier --write output.md

And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups, and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw the preview, it does matches with the pdf.
#Can someone please advise me a better approach?
hey, can you help me in doing this i can’t able to do this.

sir in the weather question could you provide from where do we get the bbc api because i have searched a lot and havent been able to find it
https://tds.s-anand.net/#/bbc-weather-api-with-python
try manually inspecting the output of the api and compare it with your script output.
Or else try refreshing the browser and check.
@carlton
Previously i got correct on q2 but now i am getting the error when i refresh the page “TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading ‘textContent’)”
Please try city=“Mumbai” as a string literal.
Q4 BBC Weather
I don’t understand why I am getting

Error: At root: Different number of properties

Is it because of different dates? Shall I match the dates?
@carlton Please guide. Thank you.

@s.anand Sir the question 10 of the Graded Assignment 4 is very tough I have tried everything from custom python codes using different libraries to online converted and also formatted using prettier. Please sir guide me how to do the question.
Yep figured that, and after matching the data solved the error and got that question correct.
Though thank you.
@s.anand Sir I have done the question 2 of the graded assignment but I am very curious to know why the answers language gets periodically change. Is there some kind of backend code which is responsible for that or is something else ?
Yes we’ll were facing this issue.
@carlton sir mentioned yesterday that they will change the question.
"We will be changing this question. Even we found it hard <img alt=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_165959/sweat_smile.png" title=":sweat_smile:" width="20"/>

So need to worry about that question for now.
OK, that is good to hear, you won’t believe that yesterday I was trying this question for 2 hours literally, it can be more also.
I was stuck at that question for 2 days, I tried multiple ways but was not able to format the content with prettier as expected, every time I was getting the error “Incorrect. Try again.”
On popular demand, I’ve made Q10 of GA4 easier (converting from PDF to Markdown). The question remains the same, but the check is more liberal and the error messages are more helpful. Please give it a shot now.
(FYI, one person did solve it. A colleague, not someone from the IITM DS program.)
Hello Sir, i tried but unfortunately after extracting the contents and formatting the contents and submitting it, it’s showing various errors like Missing links, Missing tables…
But on checking the file i wasn’t able to find any single table in the contents in that case what could be done to fix these errors?
@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini
same issue with me as well
Sir I checked the pdf file, there is only one place unorder list is given and the same is available in my answer. But the system throws error Missing List (I tried with other symbols * and + also) . Please inform me where I made mistake

I checked many times. For me it says “Incorrect. Try again.”
Ya i know, i added tables, list, blockquote, code, tables have all been added still it’s showing errors. Not sure where am I going wrong.
Please refer video and document relating to Question 1 of Assignment 3. There it is mentioned how to mark bold, table etc., use those marks
I have added all those and pasted the markdown and it appears as above.

Please help.
I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.
Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.
A post was merged into an existing topic: Tds: assignment is not submitting
your last saved score (i.e.6 of your’s) will be official score and forgot about seek portal , it is not meant for this type of assignment.
Thank you for the update! I gave Q10 another shot, and I was able to solve it this time. The more liberal checks and improved error messages made a big difference in understanding where I was going wrong.
Thank again.

In the pdf you see some blue color font for specific words write that word in format
[word](#)



There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.
All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as  link texts same as in pdf.

Link text
Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts,
below error is still observed.
Error: Missing links
Did anyone else face same issue ?

Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.
But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone.

Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.
Replace actual text to expected text until you got correct
same kind of error is arising with me too.Any suggestion what is wrong with it??
the rating should be treated as string.
Format is as “2.9” instead of number 2.9
Yes it can be done. Got the 10th one correct by implementing breakpoint by printing the expected answer which is being used to validate the user answer in the js script.

@21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.
To evaluate the bonus mark for replying to this Discourse topic, At around the time of the deadline, we’ll close this thread, load all posts here, and run this in the Console:
[...new Set($$('.names a[href^="/u/"]').map(d =&gt; d.textContent))]

… to get the Discourse IDs who posted. Then we’ll match it to the email IDs and pass it to the operations team who will add it to the portal by 2025-02-22T18:30:00Z.

This is the only thing which worked for me.
@carlton Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB.  The current example on the portal is:

Your dot of 2.9 may be the dot from alphabet or numeric one
Try to copy the value and then replace it
Try to copy the error data
The problem might be off dot
check one dot is on right of m and other right of 0 in keyboard
these two dots may represent different meanings
is it resolved?
i too am getting the same error,even if it was working fine yesterday.
https will be part of the link (provided ‘link’ is one of the checkpoints of evaluation)
Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 &gt;&gt; Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.
I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?
In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST.
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.
Good idea @23f2005138 and thanks. I fixed this. The example now reads:
[
  { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },
  { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" },

… with the year and ratings quoted.

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.
For the particular instance - “2024–”, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.
Thanks @21f2000709 for this information. I figure out where i made mistake. During writing console code I added to remove non numeric values in year field which i guess removed that hyphen (“–”). I will rectify that.

so just exchange it.
Thanks for your response.
Many such titles have contradiction from what is expected and what is there in the website. This case the samples are 25 your approach is accepted to some extent, but on a larger sample space, need to work it right !

i got this after running my python script for question 4 but, got
Error: At root: Property name mismatch" this error message
@s.anand sir,
I don’t understand this error. In the website, the movie name doesn’t have a colon “:”, but in the result it is expecting so.

For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description. Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can then use to verify the date and description.
here is the difference of  ‘:’ in the expected ans. so make it manually correct . i did the same and got correct ans .
and in the question also it is mentioned that may be manually you need to correct.  just give a try.
run your console script again and match the description.
yes, same happened with me . correct it manually.
In q10 links are not accessible through pdf and also creating problems while converting to markdown

Why question 4 starts failing. It was working correct yesterday. Because of it I am getting 9/10 marks.
The result is dynamic with changes made in the API. So try re-executing your code today and it will automatically solve. Your code is right ! Just make a re-run and things will work out <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_165959/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/>
try running the console again and it will work, make sure the data matches with the one in api as it changes regularly
Thanks!.
It is working now. I had to manually correct 5 movie titles to get it correct.

What 's the solution?
Titles (from the output json) should be replaced by the titles which shows in the error message “Expected”. It can only be done manually. There may be multiple titles need to be translated by this method.
Please refer the instruction.

you can manually add space after the hyphen
I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json outcome. Anyways the new json with same issueDate also gives the same Root error
Double-check that the rating field in the JSON is indeed a float (2.9) and not a string ("2.9") in your code.
That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method.
But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.
Write the code referencing the provided collab file and make sure to use the API key
The output actually changes once in a while so you might need to run the code a few times before getting in right

In the second question are we supposed to edit the JSON manually until we reach a correct answer ? I think the expected result has some difference from what shows up in the website

For question 10 I’ve tried everything. Links and headings work fine, but I’m not able to fix the “missing tables” issue (I’ve also tried using pdfplumber and tabulate). In the pdf as well, I don’t see any tables, any hints or suggestions would be very helpful. Thanks!

How to actually do the HNRSS one…i can’t find much.
How did u do the links? I’m unable to do links
Just copy paste the expected value in place of actual value in json. Keep doing this eventually it would be the answer would be correct.
This is a format issue when the json is scrapped from the browser.
Request help on Q4 aboutBBC weather data, the instructions in the question tell us to use BBC broker API and get issueDate &amp; enhancedWeatherdescription value pairs. However, it seems there are only 2 unique values of issueDate (not the expected 14 days)
Please clarify, sharing code and output below for reference.
Code:
import requests

url = "https://weather-broker-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/en/forecast/aggregated/" + getlocid('Bogota')
response = requests.get(url)
json_data=response.json()
print(f"The number of days data is {len(json_data['forecasts'])}")

weather_data = {}

for i in range(len(json_data['forecasts'])): # Use range to create an iterable sequence of indices
  issue_date = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['issueDate']
  weather_description = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['report']['enhancedWeatherDescription']
  weather_data[issue_date]=weather_description
  print("Iteration No. " + str(i))

Edit: For now, I have worked around with code posted by @21f3002277. But the doubt about the question remains
same with me. In the project it is written that the form should be submitted but there’s no question in the portal.
I have got the same error as well, verified there are workflows run in my repo/actions/runs
When I checked the reasons, it could be due to API limit exceeded in a hour, but tried even after some time but no workflows found.

How to fix this?
you have to manually change for a few mismatch.



<img alt="" class="avatar" height="24" src="ext2/topic_165959/15264_2.png" width="24"/> s.anand:

@21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.


Yes …due to the location difference the search results are different for everyone therefore you need to adjust it accordingly
It might need around 6-7 amendments
The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated.
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values:
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you  need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.
While submitting solution, do I need to keep all the local servers running/local URLs like 127.0.0.0 stuff, else I am getting one question as correct &amp; the other one mentions unable to fetch data!? So that means I need to run them in different different ports?
I posted this error message but now the first issue got resolved but I am still keeping it in my post so that if anyone faces same issue, they can try if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me.
Please help with the second issue.

For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.
How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works.


Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.


I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

Can anyone help me with the 10th question. Whatever I changed with the code , it is asking something. I checked that these words are not present in the pdf itself
I didn’t get any error for Astana.
The error may be due to incorrect loops in your code that’s why it’s going out of range, check for that.

It worked for me; only 4–5 values caused errors, which I fixed manually. Additionally, I corrected the console code, which now provides the correct result.
what is this magic trick… please elaborate …
Error: At [10].id: Values don't match. Expected: "tt16027074". Actual: "tt8008948"

i dont see that value in data …
You can manually edit that. I also have to manually edit one entry to get the correct answer.
Hi,
As mentioned in the question, you have to sort by “joined” so it should be “https://api.github.com/search/users?q=location:Seattle+followers:&gt;120&amp;sort=joined&amp;order=desc”
There are two “Vienna”. The question4 is referring to which one?
Manually make correction in your answer as provided in the error message. If no such words are available insert those and check
check if the action is commited
try copying the expected result and pasting it inside the quotations
Check the log of the daily commit .
Ahh, I have the same doubt too!
For the links, this format worked for me:
[ &lt; link text &gt; ] (#)
Yes I got it now. Thank you!
it should be “2.9” instead of 2.9
looks like formatting or the passed conditions have some issue… can you check and verify it once and see?
Error: At [3].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “4. 365 Days - Noch Ein Tag”. Actual: “4. The Next 365 Days”
{“id”: “tt21106646”, “title”: “4. The Next 365 Days”, “rating”: “2.9”, “year”: “2022”}
my result , there is no any entry with “4. 365 Days - Noch Ein Tag” on IMDB
I am getting missing links as error in the 10th question. How to do it?
Mine is giving 1/10 on running without even writing anything? This is happening for Q3? Is it just a glitch?
Yes happened to me too, refresh the page, mine got fixed!
Check you pdf you can find a word with blue colour and underline. Give some dummy link and use link mark with the word
Best way to solve Q2 is , look at the network tab in dev tools and get the url used for assessment and get data from it .
u have used a apace (_) after 2.9  which is not visible at front that’s why it is throwing error , it should be just (“2.9”) not ("2.9 ")
Agreed and I have tweaked my approach to get the correct answer. But I feel the question instructions should be adjusted accordingly - the question says to get every issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription key value pair - but only 2 such pairs exist ; whereas in the final answer it is forecast date &amp; weather description total 14  pairs.

Open the BBC Weather website.
Press Ctrl + Shift + I.
Select the ‘Network’ menu.
Select ‘Fetch/XHR’.
Type ‘Karachi’ in the input field on the website. Do not press Enter while entering the location; just type the location. Pressing Enter might cause ‘location?api_key=…’ to disappear.
‘location?api_key=…’ will appear in the inspect menu.
Double-click it to open a web page (https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key={api_key}). This will give the API.
Alternatively, single-clicking ‘location?api_key=…’ will open headers where you can see the Request URL and the API key.

type 2025 instead of only using 25 for the year

#question 10
Hi, Can anyone help me with Question 10?
No matter how i try to post the markdown, it is always showing that either the words are missing or are different from the original. I have tried every possible way i could think of but it is not working.
Getting this question right is a tough nut to crack…so I would rather suggest you to do using the developer tools by inspecting the source code and  putting the breakpoint followed by writing the code in the console to retrieve the expected answer

In the 10th question, how do we add headings and links to the markdown output?(getting error: Headings missing)
first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors
yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system.
but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole  redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.
this is a changing dataset so make changes to your answer accordingly and you will get it correct
Do the necessary changes as it is said below as it is an everchanging dataset.
You will get the answer correct once you make the changes asked after checking.
check you code and do the changes like max_latitude
replace [0] to [1]

Respected Sir,
How can I Solve this, I’m not able to solve this one
Hi,
For the 4th question, We can get the necessary information issueDate and its description from Summary itself right? or am I seeing the stuff in the wrong place?
Change it manually.
add the expected answer
when you press ctrl+c it turns off the server and same goes for refresh.
also you dont need to manually write ?country… just write till outline and turn on the server n you are good to go.
ok this is fine for now and its showing correct also but at the time of evaluation will my server runs??
It is written in the ques to get the link in the link tag. Not the post link.  Like this

Thank you bro, I will try this
not at all. your last saved marks will be considered
just replace value instead of it. same problem I also that time I check code and modify serval time I faced same error. so just ignore it and replace expected value instead of actual value in our Json.
extract the pdf to markdown format using chatgpt then add links,tables and one blockquote
Try to use the key ‘enhancedWeatherDescription’ parsing through the summary object (or) use the BeautifulSoup to find ‘div’ with attributes of
class: wr-day-summary

Error: At [11].year: Values don’t match. Expected: “2024”. Actual: "2024– "
You have to manually change these thing
from actual change to expected.
For me, error was almost 10 times.
on your 11th or 12th instance change it
write the actual value
If you have submitted on the assignment site and saved it in time, then that score is the actual score and will be updated directly on the student dashboard.
Your answer is correct. Just add a space after the hyphen—it will resolve the problem. Or you can copy and paste from here: '2025– '.

i wrote everything that was there in the pdf file after converting to markdown, there is no code inside the pdf file then how does it expect to have code in markdown, can anyone help
Yeah! His issue is genuine. Arnav’s JSON seems to be correct, yet these are some issues faced by him.
Yeah! even I am facing this issue. Despite lot of efforts, last question markdown seems to always incorrect. It is always throwing any sort of error for no reason.
The IMDB and weather questions was a pain along with the 10th question, wasted so much time @s.anand , the questions were nowhere tough, it was the problems with the evaluation part i had spend hours just to  sit and correct the JSON file and no comments on the 10th question’s part.
I am fine with the academia being challenging to study not the evalation making me manually edit solutions

yes change manually, there are slight changes which we have to do

@all, in q4 Actually the answer data is sync with current weather description therefore the answer changes. Make sure to update your json file before submitting.
try refreshing the page and re-run the script. as the data gets updated the answer also changes.

i 'm here for the bonus marks,
But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this.
We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course.
And i have never seen any course cool as this,

like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom  <img alt=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_165959/sweat_smile.png" title=":sweat_smile:" width="20"/>, gave client side answer checks’s code to o1 and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this)
keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI.
( i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem <img alt=":smiling_face_with_tear:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="ext2/topic_165959/smiling_face_with_tear.png" title=":smiling_face_with_tear:" width="20"/>)

why everytime question 2 answer is showing error in json?
What error are you getting @Abhay222 ?
Can you post a screenshot or error details ?
Is it safe to skip Q4 for those who got the city named Nur-Sultan, since it has been renamed to Astana, and the answer for Astana is incorrect in the portal?
@s.anand
There is possibly wrong evaluation in q6 as it is taking in 2nd latest link as the correct answer. I might be wrong, but the latest one is giving me incorrect evaluation while the 2nd latest is giving me the correct score.
getting the same issue Error: At [12].year: Values don’t match. Expected: "2024– ". Actual: “2024”
yes this kind errors.
@Abhay222 @22f3002184
if you look closely the expected value is 2024-  and actual that you are supplying is 2024.
Difference ? your value does have a - and a space at the end.
reason ? you might be scraping it ? trim() or maybe using innerText to get tag’s text ?
it seems we are intended to provide country specific versions for Individual students simulating being an analyst for MNC in various locations. Clearly you got Spain and I seem to have gotten France, although it doesn’t seem to be mentioned in the question itself.
Thank you Tanya for pointing out this issue.
Just tell me this, has your city changed? If yes then what was it earlier and what is it now.
any reply regarding this please

For question 2 getting Error: At [8].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “9. Un matrimonio di troppo”. Actual: “9. You’re Cordially Invited” But this movie is not found when searched by name


the movie may have  different title on IMDb (perhaps in another language) according to region which is why there isnt an exact match u can manually format it to get marks

    We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students. 
If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

Try changing it manually. Some values keep changing due to change in server.
Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)”
What am I suppose to do? @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

No the city is same as before. But i think it fetches the latest data. As i saved it yesterday it was correct. But today when i  clicked on save button again it got wrong.
What error are you getting ?
how to approach question 8 of ga4
For question #8. Can I use the .github/workflows that I created for the previous assignments or i need to create a new workflow?
still the same   {“id”:“tt24871974”,“title”:“12. Subservience”,“year”:“2024”,“rating”:“5.4”},

Change the value manually
I am still not sure why the github action question is not working for me. I have manually triggered the workflow multiple times but i keep getting the same ‘name’ error even though it has been specified in the code. Can somebody kindly help?
Have you given your email id in name ?

I have also use tweak that the some answer and question are check and generate on client side.
See there is difference of hyphen . Correct it manually.
Just try re-running your code once and paste in the current response. Check if its working or not.
Change the slight differences manually accordingly with the expected values

Hi,
I couldn’t able to create markdown from pdf, it showing missing links, but i couldn’t able to find the link in pdf either. I think i’m missing something.

yes
But still doesnt work
In q10 i am geeting …missing links- error
Any idea how to correct this

Check if you have made the query proprly. also, check if you taken the correct link from the item
in q10 i am getting error- missing links.
can i get any explanation about this error so that i can figure out this ?
@Saransh_Saini  as i left with this question only
Pdf content one link, I think your converting method was unable to convert link into markdown format , add it manual from pdf.
I have done that also but still getting same error
The one with blue line must be link here in the pdf.
After that it asking to add tables, i added the same but the issue ‘Missing Tables’ exists

Here for the bonus marks, it was great solving the GA4.
After you click the link, a page containing all the questions will appear. Attempt them and save it on that particular page using your IITM email ID. Through your ID, submissions will be taken.
Thankyou , but now i am getting missing code error. What it means? @23f2000573
You just have to add a space after a hyphen
Check if you are using table formating where there is a table, also there is perhaps a code block in the pdf where a small section of text is in different font than the rest.
No there is no code block in the pdf. Now i m getting missing code error. Why this error can arise @Saransh_Saini
I am also facing the same error in this question
the answer format is correct the link is probably not the latest one, I had the same issue because my code was working only for the first 100 entries… you should try paginating your code so it can cover more entries
just change the values as itis coming in the error
change the name manually as the name is diiferent on imdb according to the region, I had the same issue…
are you able do it now? Reload and check
yes facing the same thing
you are missing code block
Normal : print(123)
Code Block : print(123)
you can refer to week 2 q1  for the syntax of code block

the graded assignment is showing like i didn’t submit it. please check on this.
Your most recent score will be considered, as long as you saved it before the deadline
Here are the Discourse IDs that replied to this post. @carlton could you please add 1 mark to them in the GA (not the overall score)?

Please include only those are enrolled this term, obviously.
If they didn’t attempt GA4, please include them anyway and give them 1/10.
If they got 10/10 already, please add 1 mark anyway and give them 11/10.

As you can see in this screen shot i already tried this question and getting error so i posted it on discourse. But still i did not get any marks for attempting this question.
i got only 9/10.
Hello @s.anand @carlton Sir,
As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4 I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add that bonus mark to the total kindly.
Hoping for a positive response.
Thanks &amp; Regards
Digvijaysinh Chudasama

@22f2000008 Your roll number is in the list shared by professor Anand.

I am not saying anything regarding bonus marks. I am asking GA4 q4  about
Nur-Sultan in this question everyone getting error after post in discourse ,sir say who attempt this question get a marks .But i am not recieved this question marks
if a student has 10/10 and his name is in the bonus list, how would that look like in the dashboard?
I don’t think it is added in my case.
It will show up as 110  marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon.
Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5, is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline, but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.
is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I  understand that each set of students get different questions. @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand
