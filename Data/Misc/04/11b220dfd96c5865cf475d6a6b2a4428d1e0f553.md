This screenshot shows Google AI Studio's 'API Keys' management page. The navigation bar highlights options under 'NEW'. A prominent, but slightly greyed-out, 'Create API key' button exists. However, a red error message states that the Resource Manager project creation feature is disabled and requires administrator enabling to proceed.
