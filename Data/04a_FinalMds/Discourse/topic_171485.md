Post:  Sir, 
 The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.

This image shows a GitHub repository interface named 'tds_project-1'. It displays the '.main' branch, listing files like '.pycache/', 'venv', and 'app.py'. The latest commit ('now') updated 'LICENSE'; other recent changes include updates to '.pycache/' and 'app.py' tagged as "Final Submission".

This image represents a project evaluation report. It warns that minimum requirements must be met for submission eligibility. Four prerequisites were checked: public Docker & GitHub repositories containing accessible images, Dockerfile, and an MIT license. Three passed ('PASS'), but one failed (missing MIT License). Consequently, the overall status is 'FAIL' with a score of 0.

 Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’. 
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

 Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).

This image shows an error message from a GitHub Actions test for the repository `https://github.com/22300058/tds_project-1_git`. The submission "failed" because two requirements were not met: no file named 'LICENSE' was present, specifically missing an MIT license, and there was no Dockerfile included in the project.

Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’. 
Sir can you please consider it. Thank you!

Post:  Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.

Based on this image description:

The text indicates specific submission requirements: no \'MIT\' license or Dockerfile present. It instructs students to ensure their work meets these criteria before evaluation begins, as submissions failing the checklist won't even be scored. The note clarifies that only the latest submission will be considered by the evaluators (like the course staff).

 I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues. 
 But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. 
 Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. 
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. 
 These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. 
 Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. 
 We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. 
 I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. 
 Kindest regards

Post:  Sir, 
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query. 
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself). 
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th. 
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it. 
Thankyou!

Post:  One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.

This image shows automated pre-requisite checks for a project hosted on GitHub or Docker Hub. The Docker repository is public (previously verified), and the GitHub repository exists. However, no license file was found in the GitHub repo despite expectations of an MIT License. A Dockerfile is present.

Sir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself.

This image shows a GitHub Actions error message indicating a failed build for `https://github.com/223000585/kds_project-1.git`. The failure reasons include: absence of the project webpage ('No such page'), missing MIT license file (no 'MIT' in LICENSE), and lack of a Dockerfile.

This image shows a screenshot from a **Git repository**, displaying its current **file and folder structure** on a dark theme interface. Key items include folders like `.pycache_`, `venv`, and `Dockerfile`, alongside files such as `LICENSE` (last modified recently), `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `test.txt`. Commit information highlights details for each item, including the commit hash (`22f3000585`) and a noted count of 6 commits.
