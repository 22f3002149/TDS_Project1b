This image shows a text-based interface displaying patent questions. Section "patent questions" contains two numbered parts, Q1 and Q2.

Q1 presents the prompt: "Given a dataset which patent(s) have the highest number of claims?" It asks for Patent ID(s), referencing an example like US20220225250A1-20230720. The instruction is to either "Start coding" or "generate with AI".

Q2 only contains its question label and repeats the same instructions: "Start coding or generate with AI".
