The tasks include:\n    *   "11. Embeddings (1 mark)"\n    *   "8. Region Containing Point (1 mark)"\n    *   "9. Shortest Path Between Cities (1 mark)"\n    *   "10. Calculate correlation (1 mark)"\n*   A prompt/question is visible about writing a FastAPI proxy server to serve data from a given URL and to include CORS headers in the response.\n*   Code examples in what appears to be Python (FastAPI) are present, illustrating how to handle the URL endpoint and return data. \n*   The progress indicator shows "0/10" and "Check all" and "Save" buttons.\n*   A timer showing "00:26:36 left" suggests a time-limited challenge.\n\n**Right Panel (Thunder Client):**\n\n*   An instance of Thunder Client is open, a VS Code extension for testing APIs.\n*   The tool shows a GET request to the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/documents?q=london`.\n*   A section shows "Query Parameters" with \'q\' as the parameter and \'london\' as the value.\n*   The response to the request is displayed in a JSON format, indicating data being returned from the API.\n*   The status code is "200 OK".\n*   The response data includes a "div" element with styling information.\n*   The request/response details include timestamps indicating when the activity occurred.\n*   The bottom section of the Thunder Client shows a list of recent API requests and responses.\n\n**Overall:** The image captures a scene of a developer working on an API-related coding challenge, using a combination of a coding platform and an API testing tool to build and verify the solution. The focus is on handling API requests, processing data, and ensuring proper CORS configuration.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
