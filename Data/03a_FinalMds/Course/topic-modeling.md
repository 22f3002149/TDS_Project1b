## Topic Modeling

[LLM Topic Modeling: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a screenshot of a Google Colab notebook environment. The notebook is open and displays Python code related to generating embeddings using the OpenAI API. There\'s also a video conference window visible in the top left corner, featuring a person on a video call.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Google Colab Notebook:**\n * The main portion of the screenshot is a Colab notebook with a dark theme.\n * The notebook contains Python code, including import statements (`requests`, `json`), variable assignments (such as `words`, `topics`, `url`, `data`), and API request execution.\n * A "Secrets" panel is visible on the left, showing variables like `OPENAI_API_KE` and `OPENAI_API_KE`.\n * At the bottom, a section displays Python code to access secrets using `from google.colab import userdata`.\n\n2. **Python Code:**\n * The code appears to construct a POST request to the OpenAI embeddings API.\n * It sets headers for authorization (using a "Bearer" token) and content type.\n * The `data` variable contains the input text (`words`) and model specification ("text-embedding-ada-002").\n\n3. **Video Conference Window:**\n * A small window in the top-left corner shows a video conference call.\n * A person with short dark hair and glasses is visible in the video feed.\n * The name "Arjun S" is displayed beneath the video feed.\n\n4. **UI Elements:**\n * A toolbar at the top of the Colab notebook provides options for file editing, viewing, inserting, runtime, and other operations.\n * A "Play" button indicates code execution.\n * A status indicator at the bottom indicates that the code completed at 12:16 PM.\n\n**Overall Scene:**\n\nThe image depicts a data scientist or developer working on a machine learning task (generating embeddings) using the Google Colab platform. They are likely connected in a video conference call with someone else while coding.](https://youtu.be_eQUNhq91DlI)

You'll learn to use text embeddings to find text similarity and use that to create topics automatically from text, covering:

- **Embeddings**: How large language models convert text into numerical representations.
- **Similarity Measurement**: Understanding how similar embeddings indicate similar meanings.
- **Embedding Visualization**: Using tools like Tensorflow Projector to visualize embedding spaces.
- **Embedding Applications**: Using embeddings for tasks like classification and clustering.
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Using OpenAI's API to generate embeddings for text.
- **Model Comparison**: Exploring different embedding models and their strengths and weaknesses.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculating cosine similarity between embeddings for more reliable similarity measures.
- **Embedding Cost**: Understanding the cost of generating embeddings using OpenAI's API.
- **Embedding Range**: Understanding the range of values in embeddings and their significance.
