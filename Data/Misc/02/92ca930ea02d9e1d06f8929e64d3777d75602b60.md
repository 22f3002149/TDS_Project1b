Based on this log image, we see multiple failed web requests attempting known login and administrative paths (like `/index.html` or `/admin/index.html`). A `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.` indicates suspicious activity originating from IPs 104.234.115.27 and 154.81.156.35, which consistently result in `404 Not Found` errors. This strongly suggests a security probe or attack attempt targeting potential vulnerabilities on the web server.
