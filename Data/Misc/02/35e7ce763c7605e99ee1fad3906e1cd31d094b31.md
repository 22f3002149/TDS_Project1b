# Deliverables Checklist

This image outlines deliverable requirements for a coding project: create a GitHub repository with an MIT LICENSE file; write code to implement POST `/run` and GET `/read` endpoints, test it thoroughly; commit all changes and push them. Additionally, build the application using `podman run`, ensuring the API serves locally on port 8000, then publish the Docker image publicly. Finally, submit both the GitHub repository URL (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and the Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`) via a provided Google Form.
