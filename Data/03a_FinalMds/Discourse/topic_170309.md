# Topic: GA4 bonus marks

Sir,
I haven’t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks.
Kindly, update my marks in dashboard.

Hi @Sakshi6479,
You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark.
Here is a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:** The image is a screenshot of a text-based announcement or notice. It appears to be a communication related to a course or assignment. \n\n**Text Content:**\n\n* **Headline:** "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse"\n* **Body:** The message encourages discussion among ITM HS students. Specifically, it states that anyone who replies to the discussion of "Q14 - Data Science - Declaration Third (ITM HS Jun 2023)" will receive 1 bonus mark on the graded assignment.Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 11.02.31 am2566×224 23.2 KB
We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.
That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.
Kind regards
