The code on this line is: `AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ[\'AIPROXY_TOKEN\']`.\n*   **Error Origin:** The traceback indicates the error originated within a call to `os.environ` while attempting to access the environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`.\n*   **Error Type:** The error is a `KeyError: \'AIPROXY_TOKEN\'`. This indicates that the environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` was not found or was not set before being accessed by the program.\n*   **File Reference:** The traceback further points to "<frozen os>", line 716, indicating the error is related to the underlying operating system interaction.\n\n**In summary:** The image shows a Python program that failed because it could not find the environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN`. This suggests a missing or improperly set configuration value.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
