This graphic illustrates crafting effective AI prompts by breaking down an example request into four core sections. The **Goal** defines desired outcomes ("cool and unique adventures"). The **Return Format** specifies output structure (trail details). **Warnings** highlight potential pitfalls to avoid (incorrect data). Finally, the **Context Dump** provides necessary background information for accurate responses, all presented against a dark teal color scheme.
