This image shows an **audio waveform** from editing software, using a blue color against a black background. A horizontal **time scale** sits below the main display area containing interface elements like zoom controls. Noticeable is a white vertical **playback indicator line**, pinpointing the current position within the audio track and demonstrating its dynamic nature through movement across different points of the waveform over time.
