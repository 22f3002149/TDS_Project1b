It resembles a branch-and-merge graph.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n*   **Branching Structure:** A vertical line with diverging branches indicating commits and merges.\n*   **Commit Messages:**  Text labels along the branches describe the changes made in each commit. These include messages such as "Merge pull request #2 from deb...", "Added chardet code to get file encoding...", "Rename README.txt.txt to README_LLM.txt", "llm code week-3 23f2000573", "Merge branch \'main\' of https://github.co...", "Merge pull request #1 from painful-bug...", "Aishik Bandyopadhyay signing off painful-b...", "Add link to base64guru website. ritwiktrivedi", "Added one Nominatim API sample and ins...", and "Added file with mock1 data extraction. Adde..."\n*   **Color Coding:** Different colored dots along the branches may signify different authors, types of commits (e.g., merge requests, feature additions), or branch names. \n*   **"main" Indicator:**  A tag labeled "main" indicates the primary branch of the repository.\n*   **Visual Cues:**  Circular shapes around some commit messages likely indicate a merge commit.\n*   **Top Bar:** A banner appears at the top, reading "SOURCE CONTROL" and includes various icons for automation and operations.\n\n**Context:**\n\nThis visualization is commonly found in version control systems to show the progression of changes, branching, and merging activities in a software project. It provides a clear historical overview of code development.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
