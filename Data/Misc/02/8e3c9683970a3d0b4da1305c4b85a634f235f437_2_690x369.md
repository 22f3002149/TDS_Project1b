# Project Assessment Details from Email Screenshot

This image shows an email within Gmail discussing a project assessment. It details a scoring system where task completion awards 1 mark (equivalent to 1.25 points). A bonus based on commits and repository size adds to the total score, which is then capped at the minimum of the base score plus this bonus.

The assessment includes pre-requisites with pass/fail indicators and a table listing tasks from A1-A10 and B1-B10, mostly showing 0s. The GitHub repo URL is also provided.
