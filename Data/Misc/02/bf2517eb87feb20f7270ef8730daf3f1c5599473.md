This image shows a dark-themed VS Code screen with an error message ("The window is not responding") pop-up and a visible terminal displaying PowerShell prompts. Crucially, lines from a code snippet like "led", "10 == 0", or referencing "AIPROXY" (e.g., `os.environ.get`) are partially obscured in the editor background.
