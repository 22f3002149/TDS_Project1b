Post:  Dear all, 
 I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course:  LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator (https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom) LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator .  This is the basic prototype. 
 This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators. 
 A heartfelt thanks to  @s.anand (/u/s.anand) @s.anand , our course instructor, and TAs  @Carlton (/u/carlton) @Carlton  and  @Jivraj (/u/jivraj) @Jivraj , whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible. 
 I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to: 
 
 Expand functionality and evaluation models. 
 Fix bugs and optimize workflows. 
 Improve documentation for broader accessibility. 
 
 The  GitHub repository (https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom) GitHub repository  is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all! 
 Update: here is a video explaining the process -  https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared (https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared) https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared 
Best regards,

Post:  Hi Avinash, 
 Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project. 
 Kind regards
