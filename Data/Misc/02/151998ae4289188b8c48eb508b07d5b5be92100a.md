This image shows a terminal executing file operations related to a Git repository URL (`yamtavid/git-main...`). Commands involve using `curl` to download data, extracting files from `qmove.zip`, renaming them via `mv` and digit replacement scripts, checking with `grep`, sorting results, and generating an SHA256 checksum. The current directory is `D:\\yamtavid\\yamtavid`.
