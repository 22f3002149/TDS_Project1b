Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a coding exercise or instruction set, likely from an online learning platform. It presents a task involving file manipulation via the command line.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Heading:** At the top, there\'s a heading labeled "Move and rename files (0.5 marks)", indicating this is a small part of a larger assignment.\n2. **Instructions:** A paragraph of text explains the task. It details the following steps:\n * Download a zip file named "q-move-rename-files.zip".\n * Extract the contents of the zip file.\n * Use `mv` to move all files within subfolders into an empty folder.\n * Rename all files by replacing each digit in the filename with the next digit (e.g., "a19b.txt" becomes "a20b.txt").\n3. **Command Line Prompt:** Below the instructions is a text line that asks “What does running grep `.*` | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum in bash on that folder show?” \n\n**Color Scheme:** The background is a dark shade of blue, with white text providing contrast. This is typical for coding environments.\n\n**Overall, the image demonstrates a coding task requiring the use of command-line tools for file manipulation and a secondary question regarding shell commands.**image1296×158 7.29 KB
For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected. since 9-&gt;10 or 209 → 210 is not working
Hi anant,
Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.
In that case 209 would get replaced by 310
Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”
@21f2000370 Since you have managed to get all the answers correct, I presume there are no further issues w/ Q16.
Hi, I am unable to access Graded Assignment 1. Every time I click on the given link, all I can see is this page. Please advise.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a screenshot of a learning management system (LMS) or online quiz interface.\n* **Title:** The main heading reads "Tools in Data Science - Graded Assignment 1."\n* **Deadline:** A "Deadline" label is visible, indicating a due date for the assignment.\n* **Note:** A note is provided stating, "Every page reload randomizes the quiz. So don\'t copy answers from previous attempts. You can submit multiple times."\n* **Background:** The background is a light gray, suggesting a minimalist and clean interface design.\n* **Font:** A sans-serif font is used for all text elements, likely for readability.\n* **Overall Impression:** The image conveys an educational context, specifically an assignment related to data science tools within an online learning platform.tdsga11902×919 31.1 KB

Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.
In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem?

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Overall Impression:** The image shows a dark-themed screen, likely from a coding or learning platform, posing a challenge related to CSS selectors.\n* **Text Content:**\n * "Let\'s make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all ``s having a `foo` class in the hidden element below. What\'s the sum of their `data-value` attributes?" is the main instruction/question.\n * "Sum of data-value attributes" is a label above an input field.\n* **Input Field:** A rectangular input field is visible, with a red border. It is intended for the user to type their answer. A small red circle with a number \'0\' is present to the right of the input field.\n* **Color Scheme:** The overall color scheme is dark, with white or light-colored text and red highlighting.\n* **Purpose:** The image presents a programming exercise/challenge focusing on selecting elements with CSS and retrieving the value of a specific attribute.image1627×202 12.6 KB
Which HTML content we want to take?
Hi Suhani,
npm does not require docker.
Kind regards
Hi Hisham,
Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a web page, likely an online learning platform or a coding assignment interface. It displays a coding challenge or assessment related to CSS selectors.\n\n**Key Elements & Content:**\n\n1. **Top Banner:** Displays the due date ("Sun, Jan 26, 2025, 11:59 pm IST") and score ("8.75/10"). Buttons for "Check" and "Save" are present.\n\n2. **Main Content Area:**\n * **Text Description:** A paragraph explains that the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides documentation on CSS selectors (basic, attribute, and combinators).\n * **Interactive Tool Mention:** Refers to "CSS Diner," a fun game to learn CSS selectors.\n * **Coding Challenge:** Asks the user to find all `` elements with a class "foo" and calculate the sum of their "data-value" attributes.\n * **Error Message:** Shows an "Incorrect. Try again." message indicating an attempt at the challenge.\n\n3. **Right Sidebar:**\n * Lists files named "q-unicode-data.zip," "README.md," "Book 2\\[Sheet].csv," and "q-move-rename-files.zip," all labeled as "Removed".\n\n4. **Bottom Navigation:** Displays "12. Process files with different encodings (1 mark)".\n\n**Visual Details:**\n\n* The interface is predominantly white and gray, typical of many web development environments.\n* The coding challenge includes code snippets highlighting HTML elements and attributes.\n* A red error icon (circle with an "i") is visible next to the incorrect answer message.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the image portrays a user working through a CSS selector exercise on an online learning platform, with files related to a previous task listed in the sidebar.Screenshot 2025-01-11 at 10.29.41 PM1440×900 160 KB

Please suggest me a way to view it. I have allowed third-party cookies as well.

Hi manmeet,
I don’t know about solution to this.
Some network setting might be causing problem.
Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.
I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.
Hi samra,
Try installing some other browser see if that works.
Hi mishkat,
Without sharing code, can you pls share your approach how you are trying to solve this question.
Ok, thanks. I turned off many security features including anti-virus system’s security and windows security options etc. Then it allowed me to download uv on the system. Now it is running, and I got output as json for Q2.
2 days ago I  attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.
When I logged in today it says score is 0.
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?
If [seek] (Nptel Seekh) can access [TDS exam] (Technical Assessment) then why we need to submit from seek?
The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to  the submissions to get a score for the GA.
The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or
on the Tools in Data Science introduction page.
Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.
As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. 
We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.
For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.
Kind regards
Thanks @carlton.
I answered questions on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.
My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)
Hi @Nelson
Your answers on the exam site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).
Kind regards
It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute data-value. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute data-value.
Kind regards
I am stuck with the last question. SQLite question.
It gives the error:
Error: Got [[121510.39]]...


Is it possible to have a more descriptive error? It’s a simple SQL query. I tried various options in my query. I didn’t succeed. 
Hi Nelson,
I checked your set of questions, you are using wrong query to get answer.
kind regards

In this picture for the given question i have tried in python and chatgpt both are giving same answer still showing wrong. GA1 question
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a coding environment (likely an IDE) displaying Python code and its output. The problem the code is trying to solve is counting the number of Wednesdays within a specific date range.\n\n**Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Top Section:** A question or prompt is visible: "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-09 to 2012-06-19?". Beneath this, the answer "1349" is given, followed by "imported by agnes." and a note regarding the date format.\n\n2. **Middle Section:** This section showcases the Python code. Key parts of the code include:\n * Importing the `datetime` and `timedelta` modules.\n * Defining the start and end dates.\n * Iterating through each day in the date range to determine if it’s a Wednesday.\n * The core logic checks if the current date is a Wednesday (weekday 2) and increments a counter accordingly.\n * Printing the total count of Wednesdays.\n\n3. **Bottom Section:** This shows the execution results of the Python script. The final result states: "There are 1349 Wednesdays in the date range from August 9, 1986, to June 19, 2012." The output also shows UI elements for a feedback response: "0 of 6". \n\n4. **UI Elements:** A black terminal window with code is displayed. UI elements along the bottom of the screen indicate the file path (C:\\Users\\roy\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python39\\python.exe) and the filename (casting.py).\n\n\n**In summary:** The image demonstrates a Python script that effectively calculates the number of Wednesdays within a given date range and shows the execution and its results.Neutral Minimal Photo Collage Mood Board Instagram Story1080×1920 119 KB

The same issue is happening in the question 12 of GA1. I have given the answer by using collab and gemini , its giving the proper result but showing wrong.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a computer screen showing a code editor with Python code, accompanied by a video frame showing a man and a video title/description.\n\n**Left Panel (Code Editor):**\n* **Content:** The left panel is filled with lines of Python code.\n* **Code Structure:** The code appears to involve file handling (opening and reading files), data processing, and likely some string manipulation.\n* **Comments:** There are comments interspersed within the code, indicating the purpose of certain sections.\n* **File Type:** The code seems related to processing CSV files and handling Unicode encoding.\n* **Highlighting:** Syntax highlighting is present, making it easier to read the code.\n\n**Right Panel (Video & Description):**\n* **Video Content:** A man with short hair and a beard is shown in the video frame. He appears to be speaking directly to the viewer.\n* **Video Title:** The text "COMPUTER STUFF, THEY DIDN\'T TEACH YOU" and "Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM" are visible, indicating the video\'s topic.\n* **Video Description:** Some text is visible in the description area below the video, but is difficult to make out. \n\n**General:** The combined content suggests the user is learning or working with character encoding, Unicode, and potentially CSV file processing in Python, likely guided by the video tutorial.Minimal Square Photo Collage Photography Instagram Post1080×1080 126 KB
Hi Shouvik,
Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.
Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.
kind regards

Hi Jivraj,
I have tried with a different browser, but still not working. Below is the screenshot for your reference.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Overall Impression:** The image is a dark-themed error screen, likely from a web browser or application.\n* **Visual Element:** A cartoon-style, colorful image of a dinosaur with multiple spheres stacked on its head is positioned at the top-left.\n* **Text:** The dominant text reads "Your connection was interrupted" in a large, white font. Below this is a smaller line stating, "A network change was detected." Additionally, a code "ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED" is displayed.\n* **Button:** A rectangular, bright blue button with the text "Refresh" is located at the bottom center of the screen.\n* **Background:** The entire background is solid black.\n* **Purpose:** The image clearly indicates a network connectivity issue, prompting the user to refresh the page or check their internet connection.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2025-01-13 2240571005×714 27.3 KB

One unicode character is in both UPPERCASE and lowercase. Do a case sensitive search.
@Samra this is almost certainly due to a (typically corporate) firewall or antivirus. Please try with a personal laptop from a public / home network.
(I face this problem at office often. Once, our company’s firewall blocked our own company website )
Hi Nelson,
I checked with your dataset for this particular question. Using correct query I am able to get correct answer. Pls check sql query that you are using.

This is regarding Question 11.
I have extracted all the elements and added them manually. Tried all the options. Not even one appears to be correct . I evne tried ChatGPT which gave the answer as 411. Which of the following should be chosen?
&lt;div class="d-none" title="This is the hidden element with the data-value attributes"&gt;
        &lt;div class="bar baz" data-value="17"&gt;
          &lt;div class="baz foo" data-value="29"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md


Shouldn’t it be npx -y prettier@3.4.2 --write README.md or npx prettier README.md (Depending on whether to write or read)?
Apologies, I may not know full context of the question, as I haven’t attempted GA1 fully yet
I had this same doubt, I tried by adding the “span” tag’s value too it showed correct for me. I’d suggest you to try that.
Oh, good catch, @23f2000237 and @siva.bhaskaran - I made a mistake in the evaluation script. It included the span.
I fixed it. Note: None of the earlier answers are affected, i.e. if you got it right earlier, it’ll stay right.

It’s hackable. It’s possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That’s allowed.

What does exactly mean, if someone could elaborate without giving it away, please?
@carlton
I have tried but still am unable to do only that question if someone can help me with the code because everytime im getting a different answer its my last question
@21f2000370 i hope you wouldve completed it
Use Git bash the problem will be resolved
Hi Daksh,
Did you solve it or still facing some issues with it ?
Kind regards
im still facing issue in that questioneven after watching the youtube video given and taking help of chatgpt im unable to solve that question only
Hello Gentlemen Instructors,
In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computer’s RAM etc.,
In one of the classes, you said that there is something  - colab like cloud wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers. Will you please let me know how to go about it ??
Thanks and regards,

how to calculate How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1981-08-30 to 2017-07-17?
The dates are in the year-month-day format. Include both the start and end date in your count. You can do this using any tool (e.g. Excel, Python, JavaScript, manually).
=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY({3,7,13,8,7,7,11,11,13,14,0,13,9,14,10,7}, {10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12}), 1, 16))

Sha256sum is not recognized as an internal or external command how to solve this plzz answer
@carlton
If you are on windows, you might not be able to use sha256sum.
Here are two disussions that might help you out.

Discussion 1
Discussion 2

@Rohitkumar7463 @23f2003845
If you are on Windows Powershell
Then instead of sha256sum you can simply use Get-FileHash
Send the output of the npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md to a text file eg. output.txt and then use Get-FileHash on powershell with the output.txt and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.
You might be able to pipe the data directly to Get-FileHash but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.
Kind regards
@s.anand Sir
as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.
I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.
Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?
If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.
Here is a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a digital interface, likely from a game or application that tracks scores and saves. \n* **Color Scheme:** The dominant color is a shade of green, used as a background.\n* **Text Elements:**\n * "6 Jan 2025 at 11:59 PM IST" is displayed in the top left.\n * "Score: 10 / 10" is in the top right, indicating a perfect score.\n * "Recent saves" is a heading in the center.\n * "Reload" is the text within a button at the center left.\n * "from 20/1/2025, 6:05:24 PM. Score: 10" is displayed below the reload button.\n* **Interface Elements:** There is a button labeled "Reload" suggesting a function to restart or reload content. \n* **Data Indication:** The text details a recent save from January 20, 2025, at 6:05:24 PM, with a score of 10. This implies the interface tracks game progress or task completion.image742×336 21.3 KB
@iamsarthak – as long as you don’t save again, your score will stay 10, even if I modify the evaluation script  
We don’t re-evaluate previous results in the graded assignments.
@s.anand sir,
Question 15 is under the section for linux
I got the file which needs to be processed to answer the question
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a table-like output, likely from a command-line interface or a text-based file listing. It presents data about several files.\n\n**Specific Details:**\n\n* **Columns:** The data is organized into four columns, labeled:\n * "Length" – presumably file size in bytes.\n * "Date" – date of last modification.\n * "Time" – time of last modification.\n * "Name" – file name.\n* **Data Rows:** Four rows of data are visible:\n * **Row 1:** Length 4094, Date 2004-03-10, Time 07:49, Name file0.txt\n * **Row 2:** Length 8410, Date 2007-02-11, Time 18:46, Name file1.txt\n * **Row 3:** Length 8062, Date 2000-01-26, Time 13:40, Name file2.txt\n * **Row 4:** Length 9748, Date 2010-09-27, Time 00:34, Name file3.txt\n* **Formatting:** The data is presented in a monospaced font, which is common for command-line output. Dashed lines separate the column headers from the data rows.\n* **File Names:** The file names follow a numerical naming convention (file0.txt, file1.txt, etc.) and have the ".txt" extension, indicating they are likely plain text files.\n\n**In Summary:** The image shows a list of four text files, along with their file sizes, dates, and times of last modification. It gives information about a small set of files within a directory.image583×167 4.09 KB
I can solve this now using pandas.
From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?
@23f2000573 You can solve it with any tool you’re comfortable with, including pandas.
But since you already know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore how to do it with something like awk (or any other tool) to get a broader exposure into different approaches.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image depicts a computer screen displaying a PowerShell command-line interface. It appears to be a record of commands executed, specifically related to file hashing and path operations. \n\n**Specific Elements:**\n\n* **PowerShell Window:** A dark blue window with white text, characteristic of the PowerShell environment.\n* **Command History:** Several lines of commands and their corresponding outputs are visible. These include:\n * `cd downloads`: An attempt to change the current directory to "downloads." This command fails, as indicated by the error message "because it does not exist."\n * `npv x prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt`: A command that appears to use "npv" (likely a tool or script) to process "README.md" and redirect the output to "output.txt."\n * `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256`: A PowerShell command to calculate the SHA256 hash of a file.\n* **Hash Output:** The image displays the SHA256 hash value: `7EA1921D69EAA2FDA9F685143A291CB94CDC59E6CF6DBAA9EC8FFD4449A8F7E5`.\n* **File Path:** A file path is also displayed: `C:\\Users\\`.\n* **Screen Artifacts:** There appears to be a vertical light-colored stripe across the left side of the screen, possibly a screen artifact or a reflection.\n\n**Overall Context:**\n\nThe image suggests someone is working with files, likely involving code or documentation ("README.md"), and is verifying their integrity using SHA256 hashing. The initial attempt to navigate to a “downloads” directory indicates a possible setup or workflow issue.20250120_2039501920×1440 168 KB
Sir is it right of sha sum question
to pass the graded 1 how much points are required for 10 ?
use chatgpt for the solution(sum(take(sortby))), it will give you the wrong answer but explain the concepts, use that go to colab and code one solution(will take abt 2 mins)
I used
https://www.microsoft365.com/launch/excel?auth=1
@Rohitkumar7463 The hash code is exactly what you see under the column Hash,
7E…E5
Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt
A Hash is a nearly unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question
quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143 bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time accordingly.
I got the correct answer once i localized the files timestamp to IST.

Good Evening, I have a doubt regarding the SQL Question I have attached my query. Please clarify me where I got wrong. I tried changing the gold string to lower and checking it. Even,  that didn’t work.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n1. **Screenshot of a Coding Interface:** The image displays a screenshot of what appears to be an online coding or database query interface. It has a dark background, typical of coding environments.\n2. **Prompt Text:** At the top, there\'s a prompt asking, "What is the total sales of all the items in the \'Gold\' ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it."\n3. **SQL Query Input Field:** Below the prompt is a rectangular input field containing the following SQL query: `SELECT SUM(Units*Price) FROM tickets WHERE TYPE = \'Gold\';`\n4. **Error Message:** An error message, “Error: (1428105)!!…”, is displayed in red next to the SQL query input field, indicating the query has an issue.\n5. **Instructional Text:** At the bottom of the image, there’s further text instructing the user to “Get all rows where the ‘Type’ is ‘Gold.’ Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as ‘Gold.’ Calculate the sales as Units * Price, and sum them up.”\n\nIn essence, the image presents a coding challenge where a user is asked to write an SQL query to calculate total sales for items of type "Gold" from a "tickets" table. The query has been submitted but produces an error.Screenshot 2025-01-22 2317181599×362 19.1 KB
Thank You.
I have another doubt regarding the CSS Selector question. I know how to select elements using CSS Selector but i don’t know how to get the sum using CSS Selectors as it cannot perform arithmetic operations. And also, I didn’t understand the question completely about the ‘hidden element’. Please clarify it. Thank you so much.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image shows a programming exercise or challenge displayed within a dark-themed interface.\n* **Text:** \n * The initial line reads: "Let\'s make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all `<div`s having a `foo` class in the hidden element below. What\'s the sum of their `data-value` attributes?"\n * Below this is a prompt: "Sum of `data-value` attributes:"\n * There is a rectangular input field, designed for a numerical answer. A small red error icon is present within the input field, indicating that no valid input has been entered.\n * The phrase “Incorrect” appears at the bottom of the screen.\n* **Interface:** The background is dark, possibly black or a very dark gray. \n* **Purpose:** This appears to be an interactive coding exercise or a challenge from a web development training platform. The user is asked to use CSS selectors to find specific elements and calculate the sum of a particular attribute value.Screenshot 2025-01-22 2323381621×255 13.9 KB
It can be GOLD,gold, or even GoLD.
"  Get all rows where the Type is “Gold”. Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as “Gold”. Calculate the sales as Units * Price, and sum them up.  "
Try to go through the given video of css selector and go through all foo classes carefully(using inspect) and sum them up!
Try to remove the White spaces in your code!

You need to submit whole json becausae In this image headers is part of response, not request headers.
Hi Arnav,
I tried your script on your dataset.
Problem might be you are not executing grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum in correct directory, you would need to execute it from all_files directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.

Time of modification of each of these files is 14 Jan 2025 which might be the day you unzipped them. Depending upon what software you use it might change modification date while unzipping. use unzip command line tool or winrar extractor, these are 2 tools we have tested.

Hi Saravanan,
I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name Bob, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.
We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a screenshot of what appears to be a JSON hash or data string with an error message. The error indicates a problem with the JSON format.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Title:** At the top, the text "JSON-Hash" is prominently displayed, indicating the subject of the screenshot.\n2. **Data String:** A very long string of alphanumeric characters and symbols is shown. It\'s likely a hash value or a complex data string representing a piece of information.\n3. **Error Message:** A red box at the bottom of the image contains an error message: "Error: Expected property name or \'}\' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)".

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image shows a command-line interface (likely PowerShell) output, displaying a series of commands executed related to file hashing and formatting. The background is black with white text.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Command Sequence:** Several commands were executed:\n * `cd downloads`: Changes the directory to "downloads".\n * `certutil -hashfile C:\\Users\\sarva\\downloads\\README.md SHA256`: Calculates the SHA256 hash of the file "README.md" located in the downloads directory. The resulting hash is `eef23369e30d7b099173ef4988c65a59b80b0f56f60a4c9ab95c1903be312317`. A success message follows.\n * `npx prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt`: Formats the "README.md" file using the "prettier" package and redirects the output to a new file named "output.txt".\n * `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 output.txt`: Calculates the SHA256 hash of the "output.txt" file.\n\n2. **Hash Output:** The `Get-FileHash` command provides a table with the following columns:\n * **Algorithm:** "SHA256" (the hashing algorithm used).\n * **Hash:** `CECFD0A2CD971DE14A28CABB9F8ED854A9E6C7A94B9D788AB0D10F5D991A4F64` (the calculated SHA256 hash value).\n * **Path:** `C:\\Users\\sarva\\downloads\\output...` (the file path of the processed file)\n\n3. **Prompt:** The command prompt indicates the current directory is `C:\\Users\\sarva\\downloads`.\n\n**In essence, the image demonstrates the process of calculating and verifying file hashes using command-line tools.** This is commonly done to ensure the integrity and authenticity of files.image1677×358 22.2 KB
Finally. Got the correct one in bit dash.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n1. **Screen Display:** The image shows a terminal or command-line interface.\n2. **Prompt:** The prompt displays user and host information: "sarva@SURTYA-MINGW64 ~". This indicates the user "sarva" is logged into a system named "SURTYA-MINGW64". The tilde (~) symbol denotes the user\'s home directory.\n3. **Current Directory:** The prompt also shows that the current directory is "/downloads".\n4. **Command:** The command being executed is `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum`.\n - `npx`: A tool that executes npm package binaries.\n - `-y`: A flag used with npm/npx to answer yes to any prompts.\n - `prettier@3.4.2`: Refers to the prettier code formatter, version 3.4.2.\n - `README.md`: The file being formatted (likely a Markdown file).\n - `|`: A pipe, which redirects the output of the `prettier` command to the `sha256sum` command.\n - `sha256sum`: A command-line utility to generate a SHA256 hash (checksum) of the input.\n5. **Output:** The output of the command is a long hexadecimal string: "2ccdb77ded5f031c251d33319bc1b266018635156db88e63105943dbe7e106a1". This represents the SHA256 hash of the formatted `README.md` file.\n6. **Visual Style:** The text is rendered in a classic terminal style with different colors for commands, output, and the prompt to enhance readability.\n
I ran this directly in the console and got the correct answer.
// Select all  and  elements with the ‘foo’ class
const fooElements = document.querySelectorAll(“div.foo, span.foo”);
// Initialize a variable to store the sum
let sum = 0;
// Iterate through the selected elements
fooElements.forEach(element =&gt; {
// Get the ‘data-value’ attribute and convert it to a number
const value = parseFloat(element.getAttribute(“data-value”));
// Add the value to the sum
if (!isNaN(value)) {
sum += value;
}
});
console.log(“Sum of data-value attributes:”, sum);

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a challenge or task presented on a dark background, likely from a cybersecurity or data analysis training platform. It involves downloading, extracting, and analyzing files from a zip archive.\n\n**Text Content Breakdown:**\n\n* **Instruction 1:** "Download `q-list-files-attributes.zip` and extract it. Use `ls` with options to list all files in the folder along with their date and file size." - This sets the initial task: downloading and extracting a zip file and then using a command-line tool (`ls`) to list file details.\n* **Question:** "What\'s the total size of all files at least 2404 bytes large and modified on or after Mon, 18 Mar, 2002, 1:02 am IST?" - This is the core analytical question, requiring filtering files based on size and modification date.\n* **User Input Field:** A text box containing "485969" with a red exclamation mark indicating an incorrect answer.\n* **Feedback:** "Incorrect. Try again." - The system provides feedback on the user\'s attempt.\n* **Hint/Caution:** "Don\'t copy from inside the ZIP file or use Windows Explorer to unzip. That destroys the timestamps. Extract using unzip, 7-Zip or similar utilities and check the timestamps." - This provides critical guidance on how to extract the archive without losing essential timestamp information, which is likely crucial for solving the challenge.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n\n* **Dark Background:** Predominantly black, creating a high-contrast environment.\n* **Text Color:** White/light gray text for readability against the dark background.\n* **Input Field:** A light-colored input field for user input.\n* **Error Indicator:** A red exclamation mark visually highlights the incorrect answer.\n\n**Context/Purpose:** This image likely represents a step in a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge or a similar cybersecurity training exercise where participants must download, extract, and analyze files to find a specific answer. The emphasis on file timestamps suggests that this information is relevant to the challenge.image846×347 28.4 KB

i am not getting why my answer is showing incorrect.
can you help me in this ? @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj
Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.
i am doing so only … i can send u the example -
{   “0”: “wEfsmtde”,
“83”: “NghqzO3DL”,
“NqN7EcM”: “I”,
“vFD2C”: “KAB”}
i am not able to find what’s the mistake
Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of

Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.

Okay, i will go through my json object once.
And for hash code i am using chrome only
It worked.
Thank you
