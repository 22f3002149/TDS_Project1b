It is a dark-themed screen with white text and a highlighted input field.\n* **Text Content:**\n    * The text at the top indicates a message about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and allowing GET requests.\n    *  It asks "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api."\n    * There’s a highlighted input field containing the URL: “http://127.0.0.1:8000/api”.\n    * Below the input field, it reads “TypeError: Load failed.”\n    * The bottom line reads: “We’ll check by sending a request to this URL with ?class=… added and check if the response matches the data.”\n* **Visual Elements:**\n    * A red outline highlights the URL input field.\n    * A small orange circle with a line through it is present next to the highlighted URL, potentially indicating an error or failed request.\n* **Context:** The image suggests an attempt to connect to a FastAPI application running locally (127.0.0.1:8000). The "TypeError: Load failed" message indicates that there was an issue loading data from the provided API endpoint. The intention is to test the API endpoint by adding a parameter "?class=…" to the URL and verifying the response.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
