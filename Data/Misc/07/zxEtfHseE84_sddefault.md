This screenshot shows an OpenRefine session processing a large dataset (over 400 rows visible). A table displays business information with columns including `case_id`, `trade_nm`, `legal_name`, addresses, and industry codes. The user is actively employing facet/filtering tools in the sidebar to analyze and refine specific data entries like "365 Electrician" or "LANDIS AGER", demonstrating OpenRefine's capabilities for handling messy data through filtering and transformation features accessible within a browser interface.
