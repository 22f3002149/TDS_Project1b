i can’t load my questions
@23f1002630 - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone.
What happened? I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

The error message indicates a problem with retrieving or processing the data for the questions.image1158×466 11.8 KB
It was solved but again I’m facing the same issue
@s.anand @Jivraj  I’m still facing the issue.
i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the data in OpenRefine 2-3 times but still getting incorrect in the portal.
OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right. Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous discourse posts.

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked-
Thank you
I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.
Please consider my request and double check-

why is this incorrect ? what am i missing ? @s.anand @carlton
This one is matching every word still  that error . why sir @s.anand
yes I`m also getting the incorrect answer for question 5 even though I have clustered the city jakarta correctly.
How many units of Bike were sold in Jakarta on transactions with at least 163 units?
Same for me . I am also getting error of the answer i am getting from OpenRefine
Sir please check Q 5,8,9 also
@s.anand @carlton I have tried every method for the 5th question even brute force still I am getting same answer but it is saying incorrect.
@carlton i am also not able to do que 5th question …
Any hint
Respected @carlton
I am facing an issue with GA5 Q5, as my answer is being marked incorrect despite multiple attempts. I have processed data at OpenRefine .
To ensure accuracy, I also tried a manual approach by converting the JSON file to Excel and filtering the data, but I arrived at the same answer each time. However, the assignment portal still shows it as incorrect.
Sir Could you please check portal expected answer for this question.
Thankyou
@carlton Respected sir,
I have tried the 5 th question n no. of times but getting error as incorrect answer can i get any guidance on this please. Thankyou
@jivraj , @carlton, @s.anand
q5 give same answer which i am getting is incorrect. but i tried manually, python and openrefine, excel everything gives the same answer. please look into it.
We have noted this issue and are looking into it.
In Question 8
I am getting this error
Please tell me how do i tackle this errror
Error: At root: Array length mismatch
thanku sir also q6 i got 52747 after cleaning the json and trying to extract using all methods 96 lines where reconstructed. but portal keep saying wrong for evry answer.pls check on this also
Q5 I tried with openfire and python script , both are giving me same answer but its not accepted please check . Also in task the ask is to identify " Top-Performing City: Determine which city has the highest total unit sales for the selected product and report the unit sales number." but on top of input box question is different “How many units of Table were sold in Mexico City on transactions with at least 159 units?”
i think there is some bug in Q 1… it shows correct if in percentage I pass comma instead of decimal. kindly check. secondly by multiple logics i checked q 5 &amp; Q 6… but it shows incorrect only. Kindly help
can we get more specified error in q9? it just says, words are too different.
This message is for everyone struggling with Q5
Due to a backend error, the script was incorrectly evaluating your answers. That problem has been fixed and you must check once again.
If you are still getting it incorrect, better watch Open Refine - Live Session 
hellor sir my answer is 4764 after so many verification like excel python open refine etc but still it was saying it is wrong sir check answer please question no 4 related to 1. Aggregate Sales by City: After clustering city names, group the filtered sales entries by city and calculate the total units sold for each city.
2. Identify the Top-Performing City: Determine which city has the highest total unit sales for the selected product and report the unit sales number.

@Saransh_Saini
Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.
Now we are struggling with Q8.
MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post_id , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.
when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error : Error: At root: Array length mismatch
Reason:  below query checking only 1st comment ($[0] refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.
But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.
WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp &gt;= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) &gt; 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC;

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.
May be my query is wrong or may be not.
Thankyou
@lakshaygarg654
Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.
Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.
In this case its an ordered post_id
So thats where you begin:
SELECT post_id
FROM (
...
)
ORDER BY post_id

Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.
Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.
You will still need the post_id for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query.
...
...
FROM (
   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
   FROM social_media
   WHERE time_stamp &gt;= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
      AND max_stars &gt;= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
)
...
...

Then the final layer of the nest
...
...
(

) as max_stars
...
...

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)
But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.
Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.
Kind regards
Its been done. You will get a more detailed error now. And we have relaxed the number of errors allowed (it actually did have a tolerance limit but it was fairly tight)
sir even after applying this logic im getting error at root: array length mismatch
@daksh76 thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.
If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?
Thats why you are getting the error.
Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.
Kind regards
Thank you for your response @carlton. You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:

json_extract: “Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”
json_each: “Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”
json_extract_path_text: “Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”

Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.
I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for Q8.
Thankyou

Here\'s a detailed description of the image provided:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a document outlining a data analysis task for a company named RetailWise Inc. It details a challenge involving cleaning and analyzing messy sales data from Excel files. The document appears to be a task assignment or problem statement for a data analyst.\n\n**Key Elements & Content:**\n\n1. **Title:** "Improving Sales Data Accuracy for RetailWise Inc."\n2. **Company Description:** RetailWise Inc. is described as a firm optimizing pricing, margins, and inventory, dependent on accurate historical sales data.\n3. **Data Source Description:** The data originates from 1,000 transaction records generated from scanned receipts with issues regarding OCR inconsistencies and formatting.\n4. **Data Quality Issues (Column Breakdown):**\n * **Customer Name:** Contains leading/trailing spaces.\n * **Country:** Uses inconsistent 2-letter abbreviations alongside full country names.\n * **Date:** Uses mixed formats (e.g., "MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY/MM/DD").\n * **Product:** Includes a product name followed by a slash and a random code.\n * **Sales and Cost:** Contains extra spaces and the currency string "[USD]". Cost is sometimes missing, in which case it should be treated as 50% of the Sales value.\n * **Transaction ID:** Formatted as four-digit numbers and has inconsistent spacing.\n5. **Task Definition:** The core task is to calculate the total margin for transactions satisfying criteria:\n * **Time Filter:** Occurred on June 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time).\n * **Product Filter:** Transactions for a specific product ("Theta").\n * **Country Filter:** Transactions from a specific country (US).\n6. **Margin Calculation:** The document defines total margin as: Total Sales - Total Cost / Total Sales\n7. **Specific Challenges Highlighted:**\n * Standardize Formats\n * Standardize Date Formats\n * Extract the Product Name\n * Clean and Convert Sales From the Product\n * Handle Missing Values\n * Calculate the Total Margin\n8. **Data Example:** A small table is included with sample data showing the raw format of the Excel file.\n9. **File Details:** The Excel file is named “Sales_data.xlsx” and was last modified on May 14, 2022, at 16:25.\n10. **Output requirements:** the document outlines the expected output from the task, including how the solution should be delivered.\n\n**Visual Style:**\n\nThe image features a clean, professional layout with bullet points and clear headings to organize the information. It\'s a standard document with text-heavy content, aiming for clarity and precision.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you\'d like a specific section of the image described in more detail.{5C759A23-7CA1-4955-9D41-41F8E33D28E2}830×785 51.9 KB
In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time) for Theta sold in the US (which may be spelled in different ways).
However, when I filter in Excel for US and Theta, there are no entries for Sales and Cost. But 0 as the answer is not accepted—it says the answer is incorrect.
(I cross-checked this using GPT.)
@23f2004313
US is also called
United States
United States of America
USA
These are all valid references to US
Kind regards
I have replaced all the different names of US (all ) as “US” .
also sorted the dates as asked in the question .
I have checked your GA and I do get sales entries for the criteria in your GA.
Please remember that this module is about data cleaning. And that data needs to be sanitised before you start filtering.

this is my image i coded corrrect mapped to correct pixel but it was saying pixel do not match what is meaning of it
sorry i found correct answer i was thinking differently
can someone share the answer for the 9th question as i am facing some errors
Create your gemini api, convert the video into MP4 and then write the Collab code for the question or ask gpt to write it for you…finally run it on google collab
Hi @Algsoch @24f2003130
While saving image you might need to pass lossless = True as argument.
img.save("filename", lossless=True)
kind regards
u can use openai whisper free and use yt-dlp package to extract the video and using whisper convert it
For Q8, I wrote the following query,
SELECT smo.post_id
FROM social_media as smo
WHERE smo.timestamp &gt;= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
AND EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM LATERAL (
       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
       FROM social_media as sm
       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
       ) AS c(value)
    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
order by smo.post_id;

What it does is for each post_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post_id. Finally returns all the post_id’s in ascending order.
But it’s giving me an Array length mismatch error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. @Jivraj @carlton
P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.
yeah i did the same but the transcript was not the same. it had many differences
Sir @s.anand @carlton the answer is correct but still getting as incorrect sir

It describes the structure of data that will be provided (separated by spaces and quoted) and the types of information each data field represents.\n* **Task Description:** The task centers around analyzing successful GET requests to a web server. It specifies the parameters to consider (pages under /malayalam/) and a time window (17:00 on Saturdays).\n* **Question:** A specific question asks for the number of successful GET requests based on the specified criteria.\n* **Input Field:** Beneath the question, there\'s a text input field where the user is expected to type their answer (currently filled with "2316").\n* **Buttons:** Buttons labeled "Check" and "Save" are visible below the input field.\n* **Status Indicator:** A timer or status indicator at the top left displays "11:35:28 left" and a score of "0/10."\n* **Footer:** A footer indicates the current date and time (28/08/2023 at 12:24)\n* **Bottom Bar:** Icons and system information are displayed at the bottom.\n\n**Overall, the image depicts a data analysis exercise within a web-based learning environment.**image1920×1080 247 KB
after trying python codes chatgpt i tried using linux commands
bash-5.2$ zgrep ‘GET /malayalammp3/’ s-anand.net-May-2024.gz 
| grep -E ‘[(04|11|18|25)/May/2024:(10|11|12|13|14|15|16):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]’ 
| grep -E ’ “(GET|POST) .* HTTP/1.[01]” (2[0-9][0-9]) ’ | wc -l
2316
i’m getting 2316 but when i enter in the answer box it says incorrect
Q9 , extracted text from yt and processed the srt file,  getting 77 differences  adding any word the diff count is increasing . Please tell what i am missing here.

downloading and using this image will given an error,  better generate it yourself.
AE means UAE and so on…
Hi @23f3004114
Question 9 might not be solved 100% automatically, Manually listen to audio once or twice and correct few things.
Kind regards
Q9
Note : I found that punctuations are also checked. So make sure you include punctuations inside the paragraph wherever it is effective according to the voice in the paragraph
@21f3001379 @Jivraj  , thank you for the replies . i stopped after 8/10. need to prepare for Quiz 1.
This case is the same with me
Yeah I did…I am done with that
it is asking successful GET requests, you can know if a request is successful or not by checking the status data given in the file
Sir, Q8 is giving errors everytime.
It’s mentioned that 200-299 is successful requests
@carlton My answer for question 3 seems correct but it shows incorrect. Could you please clarify.
No, for me It ran successfully and gave me the correct answer
Try to  use an LLM I have used qwen 2.5 max if you are not comfortable with that stick to chatgpt and your console for debugging
Is the issue still pertaining for you?
Are there bonus marks for GA5?
I am also facing same issue with Q3. I tried with with shell as well as python script to find GET requests for pages under /telugu/ from 11:00 until before 20:00 on Mondays
Hello sir,
With each passing assignment we are learning many new tools.
This way of teaching is actually amazing as it will make us remember for long.
Fortunate to be a part of this course!
Thanks to the team
Yes … For u … u fixed it???
No
I couldn’t fix it
That question is same for me.
QUESTION 9
I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.
Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.
In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”
The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.
Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.
From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.
Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation "
Can anyone provide solution of question 5 related to duckdb module
please
is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I had exams and would like do week 4,week 5 before week 6 and doing the assignment is a huge part in learning, any on the just doing the assignments or answers for the assignments? I understand that each set of students get different questions. @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand
