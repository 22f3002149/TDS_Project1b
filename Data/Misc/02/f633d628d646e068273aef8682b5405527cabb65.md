**Docker Hub Error Page Analysis**

This image captures a standard "404 Not Found" error on Docker Hub. The dark blue background features a central circular graphic displaying the number 404 and text indicating the requested page is missing ("Oops! The page you have requested was not found"). Inside this circle, an illustration of a robot with a question mark sits on its screen. The specific URL shown (`https://hub.docker.com/r/abhay227/version1/tags`) confirms access to Docker Hub's interface but indicates failure likely due to a non-existent tag or private repository. Navigation buttons and search functionality are visible, along with sign-in options in the upper right corner.
