## Data Preparation in the Editor

[Data preparation in the editor: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image shows a screenshot of a code editor (Visual Studio Code) displaying a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file. The file appears to contain data related to product sales in different cities. \n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n* **Code Editor:** The interface clearly shows elements of VS Code, including the file explorer, editor window, and status bar.\n* **File Name:** The file is named "city-product-sales.json" indicating the type and content of the data.\n* **JSON Data:** The editor window displays JSON objects formatted as key-value pairs.\n* **Data Structure:** Each JSON object represents sales data for a specific city and product:\n * "city": The name of the city.\n * "product": The name of the product sold.\n * "sales": The numeric value representing sales quantity or amount.\n* **Data Examples:** The screenshot shows data for:\n * Rio de Janeiro: Bananas (82 sales)\n * Mannila: Apples (30 sales)\n * Cairo: Bananas (29 sales)\n * Lagos: Flour (72 sales)\n* **Syntax Highlighting:** The code editor is employing syntax highlighting, with keys, values, and punctuation displayed in different colors for improved readability.\n* **Code Formatting:** The JSON data appears to be formatted for readability, with indentation and line breaks separating the objects.\n* **Editor Indicators**: The bottom left of the editor shows the file type (JSON), line number, column, indentation settings, and file encoding.\n\nIn essence, the image shows a data analyst working with a dataset of city-wise product sales information using a code editor to view and potentially manipulate the data.](https://youtu.be_99lYu43L9uM)
