This image shows a VS Code project named 'llmagent' with Python scripts and Dockerfile attempting sentiment analysis on the statement "I hate you". During execution of task `tasks8.py`, HTTP POST requests to localhost:8000/run and /read fail repeatedly, often due to connection issues or data handling problems (like 400 errors). An additional HTTP request to https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings also encounters difficulties.
