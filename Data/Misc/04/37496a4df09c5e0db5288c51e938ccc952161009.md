This screenshot captures an OpenAI web page interface showcasing a text tokenizer tool. The user input field contains sample English text illustrating typical token-to-character ratios (~4 characters per token) and the approximate word count (100 tokens â‰ˆ 75 words). Below, it displays counts for this specific example (10 tokens / 47 chars), along with buttons like "Clear" and tabs to view raw text or token IDs. The tool mentions `tiktoken` in Python and a community-supported package for Javascript as options for programmatic tokenization using GPT models.
