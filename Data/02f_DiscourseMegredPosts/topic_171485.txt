# Topic: Project 1 discrepancy regarding mit license

Sir,
The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image depicts a screen capture of a GitHub repository interface. It appears to be a project named "tds_project-1," which is public. \n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n* **Repository Header:**\n * The repository name is "tds\\_project-1" with a "Public" label.\n * There is a "Pin" and "Unwatch" option.\n* **Branch Information:**\n * The current branch is "main."\n * There is 1 branch and 0 tags.\n* **File Listing:**\n * A file directory structure is shown, listing the project\'s files and their commit history. \n * Files include ".pycache\\_", "venv", "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", "MIT LICENSE", "app.py", "requirements.txt", and "test.txt".\n* **Commit History:**\n * Each file entry is accompanied by information about the latest commit associated with that file. This includes the commit message and timestamp.\n * The latest commit is for "LICENSE" and occurred "now".\n * Other commits include "Final Submission" for ".pycache\\_" and "app.py", and "First submission" for several other files about 2 months ago.\n* **Buttons:**\n * There are buttons for "Add file" and "Code".\n* **Commit Hash:**\n * A commit hash "c61a6ef" is present, alongside a timestamp indicating "now" and the number of commits ("6 commits").\n\n**In essence, the image captures a snapshot of a GitHub project’s file structure and commit history.**image1145×673 33.8 KB

Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!
Hi @22f3000585
Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).

Kind regards
Here\'s a point-by-point description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays text indicating a failed submission associated with a GitHub repository.\n* **GitHub Repository:** The repository address is `https://github.com/22300058/tds_project-1_git`.\n* **Failure Result:** The submission resulted in a "FAIL".\n* **Reasons for Failure:** The image lists two reasons for the failure:\n * Absence of a "MIT" file in the "LICENSE" file.\n * Absence of a "Dockerfile".\n* **Visuals:** The text is presented in a simple format, likely from a system output or error message. The specific reasons are highlighted.\n\n\n\nimage931×108 3.89 KB
Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’.
Sir can you please consider it. Thank you!
Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Text-Based Image:** The image consists entirely of text on a plain white background.\n* **Heading:** The text begins with "No \'MIT\' in LICENSE.No Dockerfile". This seems to be a rule or requirement.\n* **Instructional Text:** The following line reads, "Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring." This is a direction to those submitting something, indicating that certain criteria must be met to be evaluated.\n* **Note/Clarification:** The final line states, "Note: We’ve only considered your latest submissions, as we permitted students to submit more than once." This explains the evaluation process and clarifies that only the most recent submission will be assessed.\n\nOverall, the image presents a set of rules and instructions for submissions, likely related to a course, project, or competition.Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 4.49.23 PM1776×228 15.5 KB

I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.
But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.
Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.
These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.
Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.
We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.
I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.
Kindest regards
Sir,
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.
Thankyou!
One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.
Well noted sir. Thanks a lot!
Sir, I received the mail today -
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Type:** The image is a text-based output, likely from a script or automated process.\n* **Content:** It presents a series of "pre-requisite checks" denoted by a 1 or 0 indicating pass or fail status, respectively.\n* **Specific Checks:**\n * **Docker Repo:** Existence and public access is confirmed (timestamp before Feb 18th) - passed (1).\n * **Github Repo:** Existence and public access is confirmed (timestamp before Feb 18th) - passed (1).\n * **License File:** Check for a "LICENSE" or "LICENSE.md" file (expecting MIT License) - failed (0).\n * **Dockerfile:** Check for the existence of a "Dockerfile" - passed (1).\n* **Overall:** The image suggests an automated check of repository settings and file existence for a project, with the main issue being the lack of a license file in the Github repository.image652×156 5.43 KB
Sir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself.
Here\'s a point-by-point description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image is a screenshot of a text-based error message, likely from a code submission or automated testing system (possibly GitHub Actions).\n* **Message:** The message states a "FAIL" result for a submission linked to the URL: `https://github.com/223000585/kds_project-1.git`.\n* **Reasons for Failure:** The message lists the reasons for the failure as:\n * "No such page"\n * "No \'MIT\' in LICENSE"\n * "No Dockerfile"\n\nIn summary, the image shows a failure notification, indicating that a submitted project is missing a license file (specifically an MIT license), a Dockerfile, and a webpage related to the project.image836×101 18.2 KB
Sir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in the google form that was provided.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a file/folder listing, likely from a Git repository (like GitHub or GitLab) or a similar version control system. It showcases the structure of a project along with commit history details.\n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n* **File/Folder Structure:**\n * `.pycache_`: A folder, most likely containing compiled Python bytecode. Last modified 2 months ago.\n * `venv`: A folder, likely a virtual environment for the project. Last modified 2 months ago.\n * `Dockerfile`: A file, used to build a Docker image. Last modified 2 months ago.\n * `LICENSE`: A file, likely a license file for the project. Last modified 5 days ago.\n * `MIT LICENSE`: A file, renaming the license to MIT. Last modified 2 months ago.\n * `app.py`: A file, likely the main application file written in Python. Last modified 2 months ago.\n * `requirements.txt`: A file listing the project\'s dependencies. Last modified 2 months ago.\n * `test.txt`: A text file, potentially containing tests or sample data. Last modified 2 months ago.\n\n* **Commit Information:** Each file/folder is listed with a brief description of its last modification or creation event.\n\n* **Commit Hash:** A commit hash, `22f3000585`, is visible with "Create LICENSE" listed next to it.\n\n* **Timestamp:** The last modification timestamps are displayed, showing when the files/folders were last updated.\n\n* **Commit Count:** The image indicates there are 6 commits.\n\n* **Visual Style:** The screenshot has a dark theme, with white text and folder/file icons, typical of many code editors and version control interfaces.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the image provides a snapshot of a Python project\'s file structure, along with information about its commit history.image1113×487 20.2 KB
Sir can you please check.
