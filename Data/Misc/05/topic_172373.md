This image presents a multiple-choice question testing knowledge of Python's `datetime` library. The question asks which method best identifies if a timestamp corresponds to Saturday. The correct approach is checking `timestamp.weekday() == 6`, while incorrect options include using `weekday()` with value '5' or attempting string conversion via `%A`.
