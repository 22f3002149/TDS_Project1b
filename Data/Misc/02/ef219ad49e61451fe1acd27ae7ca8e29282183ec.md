This image shows a web app UI displaying Markdown headings extracted from Wikipedia content (e.g., # Contents, # History). Below is a code snippet outlining development steps: creating an API endpoint, fetching HTML, parsing headings, generating Markdown outlines, and enabling CORS. The URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/outline?country=france` triggers an error ("TypeError: Failed to fetch") during the fetch process itself.
