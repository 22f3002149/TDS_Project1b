# JSON Comparison Error

An error occurred comparing two JSON objects, specifically at the `[1].title` field.

**Expected:** `"2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey"`  
*(highlighted in red)*  

**Actual:** `"2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey"`  
*(highlighted in green)*

The discrepancy lies in the formatting of the number preceding the title, likely causing a data validation failure.
