Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a screenshot of a webpage error message. The page is predominantly black with red text indicating an error.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Error Message:** The central element is an error message stating that "Error 210113150dssstudy.imm.ac.in is not in the response."\n* **HTML Code Snippet:** Below the error message is a snippet of HTML code, beginning with the `` declaration. This suggests the error occurred while trying to load or render an HTML file.\n* **URL Indication:** At the top, it mentions "What is the GitHub Pages URL it might look like: https://user7.github.io/repo/)." This suggests that the error is happening when trying to access or load a GitHub Pages website.\n* **Background and Text:** The background is black, while the error message and HTML code are displayed in red.\n* **Page Structure:** The image seems to represent a minimal webpage. No visuals appear to have loaded.Screenshot 2025-01-12 2236301727×195 27.1 KB
i have included the email address still its giving error
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a dark screen with text instructions and a URL. It appears to be a screenshot from a software development or deployment process, likely related to the Vercel platform.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Instruction Text:** At the top, there\'s a question: "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app-vercel.app/api". This indicates the user is being prompted to provide a specific URL format.\n2. **Example URL:** Immediately below is the example URL: “https://mardakshan-vercel.app/api”. It serves as a model for the expected input.\n3. **Prompt:** At the bottom is the instruction “TypeEnv failed to fetch”. It is possible that an environment variable failed to load. \n\n**Color Scheme:** The color scheme is dark, with text in light shades, likely white or light red, for contrast.\n\n**Context:** Given the references to Vercel and "api", it seems like a deployment or configuration step in a web application development workflow.Screenshot 2025-01-12 2239561674×158 12.8 KB
that website is working fine . just  write the parameters after /api
Hi Guddu,
Can you share your GitHub repo. For GitHub pages question.
Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.
Try adding CORS to your code it might work.
Kind regards

@carlton can you please tell me what is wrong in this because I am getting “Error: Response undefined does not match expected” to my answer
Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays an error message from the ngrok service, a tool used for creating secure tunnels to local development servers. The error indicates a connection issue between the ngrok agent and the upstream web service.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1. **Header/Status Indicators:** A horizontal bar at the top shows four status indicators:\n * **Internet:** Green checkmark, indicating a stable internet connection.\n * **ngrok Edge:** Green checkmark, indicating the ngrok edge service is functioning.\n * **ngrok Agent:** Green checkmark, indicating the ngrok agent is running.\n * **Your Service:** Red \'X\', indicating a problem with the connection to the intended service.\n\n2. **Error Message:** The central part of the image displays the error code "ERR_NGROK_8012." The message states that traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to connect to the upstream web service at `http://localhost:8080`. The specific error message "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused" suggests that no service is listening on that port locally.\n\n3. **Troubleshooting Guidance (Developer):**\n * The image includes instructions for developers: "On the machine where the ngrok agent is running, make sure a web service is running on `http://localhost:8080`. Try to curl or open the address in a browser to see that you get the correct response.”\n * There\'s a link to documentation for help with this error.\n\n4. **Troubleshooting Guidance (Visitor):**\n * The image provides instructions for visitors: “Wait a few minutes and refresh the page. If that still doesn’t work, please contact the developers of this page for more information.”\n\n**Overall Context:** The image is a screenshot of a webpage displaying an error message related to a failed connection between an ngrok tunnel and a locally running web service. It provides troubleshooting steps for both the developer running the service and a visitor accessing it through ngrok.image1920×886 45.7 KB
I tired multiple times but issue is still there.
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Kindly help me out.
Hi Mishkat,
Please use  triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.
eg
if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.
Thanks and kind regards
sir did you check yet what is the problem in this one?

Hi Mishkat,
This error is because you are filtering on class_ instead of class
So if you send a request on http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S you will see response for that 1S class only.
kind regards
thank you so much after modifying the code it got accepted
Hi Guddu,
Inside index.html file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.
This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.
kind regards.
I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of an error message displayed within the Docker Desktop application. The error relates to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Error Banner:** A prominent red banner at the top displays the message "Docker Desktop - Unexpected WSL error".\n\n2. **Error Description:** Below the banner, text explains that an unexpected error occurred while executing a WSL command. It suggests potential fixes: shutting down WSL with `wsl --shutdown`, rebooting the machine, or reinstalling WSL/Docker Desktop. There\'s also a link to collect diagnostics and submit an issue.\n\n3. **Detailed Error Message:** A black box displays a more specific error message: "deploying WSL distributions ensuring main distro is deployed: deploying "docker-desktop" : importing WSL2 distro "WSL2" is not supported with".\n\n4. **Buttons:** At the bottom, there are two buttons:\n * "Gather diagnostics" (yellow button)\n * "Quit" (blue button)\n\n5. **Policy Link:** A small link reads "Read our policy for uploaded diagnostic data".\n\n**Color Scheme:** The dominant colors are red, black, yellow, and blue. The red banner and yellow button are used for emphasis, while black serves as the background for the detailed error message.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the image captures an error state within Docker Desktop, indicating a problem with WSL2 integration.Docker Desktop Error558×377 27 KB
I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).
wsl --version
WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1

So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?
Hi Telvin,
Try opening localhost:8080 in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.
I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.

@Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop.
Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.
@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.
@22f2001640 in that case

a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested

You could try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work.
Thank you, Sir!

What is the Docker image URL? It should look like: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general

If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps correctly?
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a computer screen displaying a terminal window with Python code and a web browser displaying a coding challenge or assignment. The coding appears to involve creating an API endpoint.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n* **Terminal Window:**\n * The terminal window is predominantly black.\n * It displays lines of Python code that seem to be executing, indicated by timestamped `INFO` messages.\n * The code involves handling API requests, specifically for `/api/class`.\n * There is output showing a JSON response with student data: `{"studentId":1288, "class":"15"}, {"studentId":1288, "class":"15"}`.\n * The code uses Flask or a similar Python web framework, based on the lines containing `app.run` and path definitions.\n\n* **Web Browser:**\n * The browser window displays a coding assignment with a green header: "Exam: Sanand.workers.dev16-2025-01-ga2".\n * A deadline is displayed: "Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST".\n * A score of "5.5/10" is visible.\n * The assignment description concerns handling a query parameter "class" in the API endpoint, specifying how it should filter student data.\n * A sample API URL, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/class=1A`, is provided as an example.\n * There is text highlighting the importance of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and a question regarding the API URL endpoint for FastAPI.\n * A code example, potentially a solution or example, is displayed in the browser window with a "..." indicating more code.\n\n* **General UI Elements:**\n * The operating system appears to be macOS, based on the dock and window controls.\n * Multiple browser tabs are open: "127.0.0.1:8000/api/class=15", "GA2 - Deployme…", "Push Docker Im…".\n * A time is visible in the top right corner: 12:12 AM.\n\n\n\n**In summary:** The image captures a developer working on a coding assignment involving creating an API endpoint that filters student data based on class using Python and potentially Flask/FastAPI.Screenshot 2025-01-15 at 12.12.09 AM1440×900 312 KB
@carlton my answer got excepted before but now it is only working on the terminal after I modified the code but when I paste the url in the answer box it is again showing error
Hi Mishkat,
The GA url encoded parameter is class
In your screenshot, you are using class_
Your code that we examined earlier also accepts class_ as the parameter instead of class as required by the GA
The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter class
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a web browser window displaying an error message from "ngrok", a tunneling service. The error message is highlighted within a red-bordered box.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Browser Interface:** The screenshot shows a standard web browser window with tabs at the top.\n2. **Ngrok Error Message:** A prominent red box displays the error "ERR_NGROK_8012". The message states that the traffic was successfully tunneled but failed to connect to the upstream web service at `http://localhost:5000`. \n3. **Error Details:** Within the red box, the error details indicate a connection refused issue (dial tcp [::1]:5000: connect: connection refused).\n4. **Developer/Visitor Guidance:** The error message includes guidance for both the developer and the visitor of the page. \n * **For developers:** It instructs them to ensure a web service is running on `http://localhost:5000`.\n * **For visitors:** It advises them to refresh the page or contact the developer.\n5. **Ngrok Branding:** The message is "Powered by ngrok" at the bottom of the error screen.\n6. **Status Indicators:** Above the error message are indicators with green and red checkmarks representing the status of "Internet", "ngrok Edge", "ngrok Agent", and "Your Service". The "Your Service" indicator is red, signifying a failed connection.\n\n**In essence, the image depicts an error state within the ngrok tunneling service, indicating a failure to connect to a local web service running on the user\'s machine.**Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 8.54.07 PM1440×900 80.5 KB

@Jivraj this is the code I’m executing which is not getting accepted in the answer box the last time I modified the code it got accepted and I also saved the answer but when I reopened the page till now it is not getting accepted
Hi Mishkat,
In your code, the word class is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing class_ to class is not going to work. The only thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api not the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.
Kind regards
Hi Team ,
For GA - 2 , Question 6:
I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel.
And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.
But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a web development environment, likely a browser\'s developer tools, showing a debugging/network request process. It appears a Python application deployed on Vercel is being tested, and an error is occurring.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1. **Top Section - Instructions/Context:**\n * A text instruction indicating downloading of a \'gwcivil-python.json\' file which contains marks of 100 students.\n * Another instruction to create and deploy a Python app to Vercel with a specific URL endpoint.\n * A red highlighted error message stating "TypeError: when attempting to fetch resource."\n\n2. **Bottom Section - Developer Tools (Network Tab):**\n * A network request log showing several requests with details like:\n * **Name:** Different URLs including "gwcivil-python.json"\n * **Status:** Showing some successful requests (e.g. 200 OK) and a request with "Failed" status.\n * **Type:** Shows request types like "doc", "xhr", "js".\n * **Initiator:** Shows the source code from where the request originated.\n * **Size:** Transfer sizes are also displayed.\n * **Time:** Duration of the request is displayed.\n\n3. **Visual Indicators:**\n * Red highlighting around the error message.\n * Orange highlighting around the network requests in the developer tools tab.\n\n**In summary:** The image depicts a developer debugging a Python application deployed on Vercel, encountering a TypeError when fetching a resource, with the relevant network requests visible in the browser\'s developer tools.Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 6.58.43 PM3570×1344 436 KB

Hello, this is working when I put in parameters, but not when I submit on quiz portal. What to do?
Hi @carlton @Jivraj ,
Can you please help on this one.
Hi Kushagra,
can you share vercel url so that I can test.
Kind regards
Hi Aindree,
I tried to send a request to your application https://your-app2.vercel.app/api with url encoded parameter class=7Q. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends {"marks": []}.
Check if your csv file is correct.  Also check if code is correct.
Kind regards
Jivraj
For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue
@s.anand
Hi Tushar,
For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.
For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.
Kind regards
Jivraj
https://your-app2.vercel.app/api?name=gy5&amp;name=nk&amp;name=ySOPVNRtt
is the one I tried. Somehow it worked correctly at my end. I’ll recheck though. Thanks
Hi Jivraj,
I tried with another public url, It is working for me now.
Thanks

Hi,
I have downloaded the Llamafile as instructed. But I can’t run it on my mac. It says command not found.
Pls let me know what I should do.
For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.
Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Overall:** The image shows a user interface element indicating a file upload attempt and subsequent error message.\n* **Top Text:** Displays the instruction, "Upload your losslessly compressed image (less than 1,500 bytes)."\n* **File Selection Field:** A labeled box reading "Choose File" with the filename "shapes_compressed.png" displayed within it, indicating a file has been selected.\n* **Error Message:** A red-bordered message states, "Error: Could not process image. Is it a browser-supported image? Image pixels do not match the original". This suggests an issue with the selected image\'s format or integrity.\n* **Color Scheme:** The interface uses a dark background with white and red text.\n* **Purpose:** The image shows a potential failure in an image upload process, likely within a web application.image830×156 10.3 KB
this mainly happens when ngrok able to tunnel to given port but nothing is running on that port,so check that first
i am getting this error
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a dark-themed screen with text and a URL displayed within a rectangular box. It appears to be a screenshot from a coding or web development environment, likely related to deploying a Python application. \n\n**Specific Elements:**\n\n1. **Text Instructions:** There\'s text at the top explaining the task: download a "vercel python" app that handles the marks of 100 students. It details how to create and deploy a Python app on Vercel, exposing an API.\n2. **Example JSON Response:** A sample JSON response is displayed, demonstrating the expected format for the marks of students X and Y, showing `"marks": [10, 20]`.\n3. **Vercel URL:** The core of the image is a URL displayed in a rectangular box with a red background. The URL is: `https://get-marks-gb9zwndx-tushars-projects-12a54030.vercel.app/api`. \n4. **Error Message:** Below the URL, there’s an error message, “TypeError: Failed to fetch”. This suggests an issue with accessing the API endpoint at the given URL.\n5. **Color Scheme:** The overall color scheme is dark, with white text and a red error indicator.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe image is likely a demonstration or tutorial relating to deploying a Python API on the Vercel platform. The screenshot shows the URL of the deployed API and the error message indicating a problem with fetching data from it. It suggests there\'s an issue preventing the API from functioning correctly, potentially a server-side error or network problem.image1636×415 30 KB
i have tried to submit it will a query as well but than also it is giving me the same error.But for me it is giving me the correct output.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:** The image displays a browser window showing a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) response. The background is black.\n\n**Elements:**\n\n* **Browser Tab:** The browser tab shows a URL: "student-marks-gb9zwxnfxx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/?api/?name=ljjOGaVw&name=Ry2NzqyxV". This suggests an API endpoint for retrieving student marks.\n* **JSON Data:** The main content is a JSON object containing a single key-value pair:\n * **Key:** "marks"\n * **Value:** An array of two numerical values: "[65, 74]". This likely represents the marks or scores for a student or a set of students.\n* **"Pretty-print" Label:** At the top-left, there is the label “Pretty-print” which indicates that the JSON data is formatted for better readability.\n\n**Interpretation:** This image shows a successful API response that provides a student\'s marks, which are 65 and 74. The URL suggests that the API receives student names as parameters for requesting marks.image1065×178 7.32 KB

@Jivraj @carlton
i have added the header key in order to use the cors as said in the vercel doc but still i am getting that error.
what to do?
i have added the cors in the app.py file as well
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
from flask_cors import CORS


app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# Load the data
with open("q-vercel-python.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)


@app.route("/api", methods=["GET"])
def get_marks():
    names = request.args.getlist("name")
    marks = [student["marks"] for student in data if student["name"] in names]
    return jsonify({"marks": marks})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

While I understand why you might choose to use flask due to your familiarity with it,
the http.server library is just very simple to use.
The only extra line of code you would need inside your get request if you used the http.server library would be:
self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
Try to rewrite your code using http.server  library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.
The boilerplate code for a get request using the http.server library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.
Kind regards
In GA-2 Q6, Q9 and Q10 answers are not getting accepted on my device(Mac book air) but when I am executing the same thing from my friends device(windows 11 pro) it is getting accepted and then when I try to save it from her device and then do the final submission from my my device then again the answers are not getting submitted for the same three questions.
@s.anand  Sir please help me through this
@23F300327 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.
GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.
Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.
Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.
There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.
The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy

@23F300327
Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.
When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api
with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.
The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.
That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this
# api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return

Notice there is no if __name__ == "__main__": code block.
This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.
if __name__ == "__main__": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.
Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.
Another possible problem:
By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS &gt; Development Tools &gt; unicode
So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.
Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

I tried both the url in domain still it is showing failed to fetch
Hi NamanBeri,
Just remove .git it will work.
[UPDATE 22/02/2025]: GA 2 NEW DEADLINE: 2025-02-02T18:29:00Z
I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a vercel.json configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code.
You can follow Gui Bibeau’s guide to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.
For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to this guide on DEV Community. I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.
Okay,  I’ll try to it again using these methods and let you know
Thank you

The page offers instructions for both the developer and the visitor to resolve the issue.image1566×912 46.1 KB
I tried using github codespace for ngrok  and cmd for llamafile, but im still encountering the same error no matter which port i use @Jivraj
Hi Naman,
error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a google search Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is &amp; How to Fix It). I tried submitting now while replying at 2:45 am it was working fine.
@s.anand Is there any problem from our end, such as tds hosting server receiving lots of traffic on website.
Hi daniyal,
Tools in Data Science you can get calendra invite link from here and add to google calendra.
Hi Srividhya,
This error is because you are trying to access a feature of ngrok which requires to pay ERR_NGROK_501 | ngrok documentation.
I think you didn’t use authtoken to authenticate through your laptop. Follow second step on this page Quickstart | ngrok documentation to authenticate.
kind regards
Jivraj
Hi Irina,
This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine.
Here is reference of error ERR_NGROK_8012 | ngrok documentation
kind regards

I’m leaving the url running, you can see you get a dummy response(clicking the link), how should i go about it. I’d prefer to use codespaces. Please help me
No problems, I got it , SOLUTION just made the port public
for the tunneling, i am currently unable to do it has the ports are mismatched, I’m still working on the issue, but using codespaces and public ports i’ve achieved similar results and the question is marked right. Is this wrong/unethical. I will try to tunnel using ngrok though

@23f1002382
Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.
That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.
Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!
So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.
In the meanwhile:

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a promotional graphic comparing Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers, likely for a tech-related presentation or marketing material. It visually contrasts the two technologies using server rack imagery and text overlays.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n\n* **Server Racks:** The dominant element is a representation of server racks filled with monitors displaying different types of data.\n* **VM Side:** On the left side, the server monitors predominantly show screens labeled “Virtual Machines,” "Email," "Webserver" and "Database". The color scheme is blue and green.\n* **Container Side:** On the right side, the monitors display "Containers", "Application," and charts. The color scheme is green, red, and yellow.\n* **Text Overlay:** Large white text is overlaid on the image, prominently stating "VMs vs CONTAINERS". "ANIMATED" appears at the bottom left and "CONTAINERS" at the bottom right.\n* **Branding:** The top right corner features a logo reading "PowerCert."\n* **Color Scheme:** The overall color scheme is dark, with bright colors (blues, greens, reds, and yellows) used for the monitor displays and text to create contrast and draw attention.\n\n**Overall Message:** The image is intended to visually represent the differences between Virtual Machines and Containers, highlighting them as distinct technologies within a server environment.


There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.
Kind regards
thank you. you have no idea how much this helps sir
Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.
Can you clarify why this is happening?
because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.
Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.
The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.
Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”
Kind regards
hi @23f2003853
I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify  ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of 127.0.0.1. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.
Hello Sir,
I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Background:** The image has a black background.\n* **Text:** It displays a series of text instructions and an error message, likely from a software development or web deployment context.\n* **Instruction 1:** "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."\n* **Instruction 2:** "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api"\n* **Input Field:** A rectangular input field with the following URL: "https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api". The field is highlighted with a red border.\n* **Error Message:** A red text message reading "Error: Expected [73,73,53,63,61] but got [73,53,61,63,73]". \n\n**Overall:** The image appears to be a snippet from a setup or configuration process, where a Vercel URL is being requested. There is an error occurring due to an expected input not matching what was provided.image858×234 14.2 KB

Hi Shalini,
I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.
Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel,  just check your code if it’s logically correct.
Kind regards

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a Python code snippet. It appears to be the backend logic for an API endpoint, likely a serverless function (indicated by the path "../.vercel/python.json"). The code handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers and processes a query parameter named \'name\'.\n\n**Code Details:**\n\n1. **Imports:**\n * `json` - Used for handling JSON data.\n * `os` - Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.\n * `http.server` - For creating HTTP request handlers.\n * `urllib.parse` - Used for parsing URLs (specifically the query string).\n\n2. **Class Definition:**\n * `handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler)` - Defines a custom request handler class that inherits from `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`.\n\n3. **`do_GET(self)` Method:**\n * **CORS Headers:** Sets CORS headers to allow requests from any origin.\n * **Load JSON Data:** Loads JSON data from a file located at "../.vercel/python.json".\n * **Parse Query Parameters:** Parses the query string from the URL using `urllib.parse.qsurlparse` to extract the value associated with the \'name\' parameter.\n * **Error Handling:** If the \'name\' parameter is not present in the query string, it returns an error message in JSON format.\n * **Collect Marks:** If the \'name\' parameter is present, it appears to collect \'marks\' based on the provided name (the logic for this is not fully visible in the screenshot).\n * **Return Response:** Returns the collected \'marks\' in a JSON response.\n\n4. **`do_OPTIONS(self)` Method:**\n * **CORS Support:** Handles preflight requests (OPTIONS requests) for CORS, setting the appropriate headers to allow cross-origin requests.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n* The code likely forms part of a serverless function deployed on Vercel (based on the file path).\n* The primary function is to receive a \'name\' parameter via a GET request, process it, and return some data (\'marks\') in JSON format.\n* The code includes error handling to return an informative message if the \'name\' parameter is missing.\n* CORS headers are handled to allow requests from any origin, indicating the API is intended to be publicly accessible.\n\n\n\nimage871×900 40.7 KB

could you also give me a hint
I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.
In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)
I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp.
Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

 daksh76:

I have laready tried doing that as well but it still doesnt seem to work


Hi @daksh76, Can you mention exact error or problem that you are facing.
The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using 127.0.0.1 and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with http://localhost:8000/api to see if it works.
If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the ipconfig command to check the correct IP address.
We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

This url shows correct but after few hour it shows this error
@carlton  pls help me to fix this
you need to keep the services running. Else it will fail. Do whats required, regenerate that link and paste it once you complete and save it. this way you can avoid rework.
sir the output im getting after correcting the code is showing incorrect on the portal
if you could suggest me why is that happening, where am i making an error because i have cross checked this a lot of times and still am unable to understand where i might be making a mistake
I had faced the same issue. Please ensure the url is not protected against the access of third party (IITM will access your url. To check it, try to open the url in different browser)
Hi sakshi in vercel problem i also had similar error. remove this code if name == ‘main’:
24 # app.run(debug=True) frm your flask app then run it. it worked for me i found this with the help of chatgpt. vercel has some built in features to run so this is not required it seems.
I was facing problem that how to make a class as variable name for Q9 in GA2 . but now i get a solution which was helpful for making class as variable. The below command is the solution for the problem of how to make a class variable name in python.

the async def root() this command line in image is solution for our problem.
Hi Srividya,
Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.
This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).
In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.
This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.
Thanks for your input.
Kind regards
@carlton @Jivraj  sir pls help me to fix this issue
Questions 9 and 10 require running a development server from my side. Right now, the questions are marked correct and I’ve saved the assignment. Since the servers won’t always be running, I hope this won’t cause a problem during evaluation.

@ 24ds1000082_Vivek
Hi @23f2004644 and @bhashwar_sengupta ,
You would need to keep all the servers active whenever you click on save button.
Hi @23f2003853 ,
did you enable cors ? If yes then pls send screenshot of console and network tab.
Kind regards
So if I kept the server running and saved the answer, but after reloading it’s showing incorrect
We can’t just keep it running.
Hi @daksh76 ,
I didn’t actually used python to solve this particular question.  I tried for some time but it was not working. So I just used Squoosh, for now pls use this.
whenever you want to submit your answers by pressing save button at that time only all servers should must be running.
I did that, while running all the severs i saved my answers and it showed “correct”.
But after sometime when I re-loaded my answers it showed incorrect.
Hi @24ds1000082_Vivek, @23f3004114 ,
You guys are not using correct format for response.
{
  "students": [
    {
      "studentId": 1,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 2,
      "class": "1B"
    }, ...
  ]
}

This is correct for which have a object with key students which is not present in your response.
kind regards
That’s okay, when you click on save answers button just make sure all servers are running.
Yes Hari, most probably that’s what the problem is. @23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL Check if cors are enabled.
Kind regards
@ carlton @ Jivraj
Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.
Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.
Do I need to do anything else ?
Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.
Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks &amp; regards.

Yes sir. I did keep them active when saving the assignment and the answers were saved successfully(The score was 10/10). I was talking about evaluation after deadline.
In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with --n-gpu-layers 35 parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that.
@carlton @Jivraj did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n1. **Browser Window:** The image shows a browser window with a URL in the address bar: "new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m".

please look into this @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini
https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&amp;name=m
Try these @21f3000745

Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.
If this doesn’t work, then:
Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.
Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

yeah it worked. thankyou @Saransh_Saini
actually on every reload of page , it generates new data which makes question so tedious.
So the problem was with the JSON data or you just clicked again on check and it worked?
i loaded the data again as you said and clicked on check again. then it gave correct

Hi @23f2000573 ,
As error mentions to add tag to image.
Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a particular tag can be pulled.
For adding tag use
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a terminal or command-line interface window.\n* **Text:** The window contains a series of commands intended to build, run, and deploy a container.\n* **Commands:**\n * The first command set instructs the user to create an account on hub.docker.com and then login to docker.io using `podman login docker.io`.\n * The second set of commands builds and runs a container named `py-hello` using `podman build -t py-hello` and `podman run -it py-hello`.\n * The third command pushes the container to Docker Hub, with instructions to replace `$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` with the user\'s actual Docker Hub username. \n * The final command shows how to push the container with a specific tag (e.g., "dev").\n* **Formatting:** The commands are preceded by comments (lines starting with `#`) that explain their purpose.\n* **Background:** The background is dark, typical of a terminal window.\n* **Overall:** The image functions as a set of instructions for working with containers, specifically using the `podman` command-line tool.image1351×578 40.8 KB
For GA2 there is not question that asks if you visited GA2 page or not.
Just answer on GA2 page TDS 2025 Jan GA2 - Deployment Tools.
Hi @24f1002359
For Question 10, ensure that all servers are running every time you submit (click the Save button). Since ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs, double-check that the ngrok URL is correct before submitting.
For Question 9, did you enable CORS? To verify, check your browser console—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a browser\'s developer console, likely from Chrome or a similar browser. It displays log messages and an error related to a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1. **Console Interface:** The top of the image shows the console\'s tabbed interface, including tabs for "Elements," "Console," "Sources," "Network," "Performance," "Memory," and "Application."\n2. **Log Messages:** Two log messages are visible:\n * "starting ajax request to the resource"\n * "ajax request done."\n3. **CORS Error:** The prominent element is a red error message:\n * "Access to XMLHttpRequest at \'http://google.com/\' from origin \'null\' has been blocked by CORS policy."\n * The error message indicates that a request to `http://google.com/` was blocked due to the browser\'s CORS policy. The origin is reported as “null.”\n * The message specifically states that the requested resource doesn\'t have an "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header, which is required to allow cross-origin requests.\n4. **File/Line Numbers:** Each message and error includes a file name ("index.html") and line number, which helps pinpoint the location in the code where the messages originated. (e.g., "index.html:14," "index.html:29," and "index.html:1").\n\n**In Summary:** The image shows a developer console logging an AJAX request and then reporting a CORS error when attempting to access a resource from a different origin (in this case, Google) without proper CORS headers enabled on the server. This is a common issue when building web applications that make requests to APIs on different domains.image724×136 18.3 KB
For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally.

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a snippet of Python code, likely from an interactive environment like Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE. The code appears to define a function related to an API endpoint.\n\n**Code Breakdown:**\n\n* **`@app.get("/api")`**: This is a decorator, probably from a web framework like FastAPI or Flask. It suggests that the following function will be mapped to an HTTP GET request at the `/api` endpoint.\n* **`def api(class_: Annotated[List[str] | None, Query(alias=\'class\')] = None)`**: This line defines a function named `api`.\n * `class_`: This is a function parameter representing a list of strings, or potentially `None`.\n * `Annotated[...]`: This is a type hinting feature in Python, used to add metadata to the parameter.\n * `List[str]`: It specifies the type of the parameter, which is a list of strings.\n * `Query(alias=\'class\')`: This likely comes from a web framework (FastAPI) and indicates that this parameter should be read from a query string in the URL. The parameter in the URL would be named "class," but inside the function, it is referred to as `class_`.\n * `= None`: This sets a default value of `None` for the `class_` parameter, implying it\'s optional.\n\n**Color Coding:**\n\nThe code has color coding, suggesting the use of an IDE or editor with syntax highlighting. The colors differentiate keywords, variables, and data types for improved readability.\n\nIn essence, the image represents a function definition for handling an API request at the `/api` endpoint, which expects an optional query parameter named "class" that is a list of strings.

Gentleman,
Will you consider my mark or not ?
Gentleman,
I dont understand. I just now, on triggering the Github action, I copied the url of my github repository. It worked !
The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.
If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.
I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.
I had submitted the assignment in the evening, but now in the portal it’s showing not submitted.
