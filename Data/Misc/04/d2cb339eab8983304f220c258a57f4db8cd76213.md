This image shows the dark mode interface of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) open on a `Dockerfile`. The explorer panel displays files like `requirements.txt` alongside project folders such as `.env`, `app`, and `data`.

The visible Dockerfile contains Python-based instructions for building an application container, including commands to install dependencies from `requirements.txt` using pip. Terminal output confirms the successful startup of a server process running the application inside the Docker environment.
