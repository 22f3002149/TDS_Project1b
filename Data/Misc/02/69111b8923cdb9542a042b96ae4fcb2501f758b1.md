This image shows an error message from a Pyodide environment (likely within a Python code snippet). The core issue is that the "scipy" module is missing.

To resolve this, you can install it in your Python context using `await micropip.install("scipy")`. Alternatively, if working directly in JavaScript with Pyodide, use `await pyodide.loadPackage("scipy")`.

Pyodide documentation provides more details on loading packages: [https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/loading-packages.html](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/loading-packages.html).
