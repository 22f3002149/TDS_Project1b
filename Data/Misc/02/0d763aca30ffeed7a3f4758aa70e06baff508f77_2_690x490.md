This dark-themed error screen clearly communicates a network connectivity issue. A top-left dinosaur illustration contrasts with large white text stating "Your connection was interrupted" and displaying the specific error code `ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED`. Below the main message appears a smaller prompt: "A network change was detected." The interface includes a bright blue refresh button at the bottom center on a solid black background, guiding users to resolve the problem.
