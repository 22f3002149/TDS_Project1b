## Terminal: Bash

UNIX shells are the de facto standard in the data science world and [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is the most popular.
This is available by default on Mac and Linux.

On Windows, install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to get a UNIX shell.

[How to Install Ubuntu on Windows 10 (WSL) (12 min): Here's a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Composition:** The image showcases two distinct operating system logos positioned side-by-side on a gradient background.\n* **Left Logo:** On the left is the logo for Ubuntu, a Linux distribution. It's a circular design featuring three orange figures interlocked in a chain-like formation, enclosed within a white circle.\n* **Right Logo:** To the right is the Windows logo, represented by a square divided into four equally sized squares of varying shades of blue.\n* **Background:** The background is a gradient transitioning from a darker maroon on the left to a warm orange-red on the right, creating a visually dynamic backdrop.\n* **Elements between the logos:** Between the Ubuntu and Windows logos, there are small white dots that look like a dashed line, possibly suggesting a connection or transition between the two systems.\n* **Overall Impression:** The image seems to compare or relate the Ubuntu and Windows operating systems, potentially hinting at dual-booting or compatibility."](https://youtu.be_X-DHaQLrBi8)

Bash Scripting Essentials:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
NAME="value"
echo $NAME

# Loops
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo $i
done

# Conditionals
if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists"
fi

# Functions
process_data() {
    local input=$1
    echo "Processing $input"
}
```

Productivity Tips:

1. **Command History**

   ```bash
   history         # Show command history
   Ctrl+R         # Search history
   !!             # Repeat last command
   !$             # Last argument
   ```

2. **Directory Navigation**

   ```bash
   pushd dir      # Push directory to stack
   popd           # Pop directory from stack
   cd -           # Go to previous directory
   ```

3. **Job Control**

   ```bash
   command &      # Run in background
   Ctrl+Z         # Suspend process
   bg             # Resume in background
   fg             # Resume in foreground
   ```

4. **Useful Aliases** - typically added to `~/.bashrc`
   ```bash
   alias ll='ls -la'
   alias gs='git status'
   alias jupyter='jupyter notebook'
   alias activate='source venv/bin/activate'
   ```
