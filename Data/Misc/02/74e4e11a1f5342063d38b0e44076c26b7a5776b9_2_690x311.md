This image shows a coding challenge interface. The task involves deploying a Python application to Vercel that downloads student marks data from a JSON file named "q-vercel-python.json". It must expose an API endpoint accepting GET requests with parameters `?name=X&name=Y`, returning the corresponding marks as a JSON response (`{"marks": [X_marks, Y_marks]}`). If the expected values (like `[35,71,83,96,95]`) don't match the actual output, an error occurs.
