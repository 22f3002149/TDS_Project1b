The address bar shows the URL: `exam.sanand.works/tds-2025-01-03-3fhq-get-llm-to-say-yes`.\n2.  **Score & Buttons:** In the upper left corner, a score is displayed: "Score 8.5/8.5".  Buttons labeled "Check all" and "Save" are present next to it.\n3.  **Instructions (Numbered List):** A numbered list of instructions is prominently displayed:\n    *   Requires passing an authorization header with a dummy API key.\n    *   Specifies to use "gpt-do-min" as the model.\n    *   The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze sentiment (GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL).\n    *   The second message must be the exact text contained above.\n4.  **Test Description:** Following the numbered list, there’s a paragraph describing the purpose of the test, validating API integration and message formatting. It emphasizes reliability for categorizing data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL.\n5.  **Note:** A note indicates the use of a dummy `httpx` library.\n6.  **Code Snippet (Python):** There’s Python code illustrating the `httpx` request/response interactions.\n7.  **JSON Data (Code Block):** Below the code is a JSON data block. This structure defines the message format for the LLM:\n    *   `"model"`: set to "gpt-do-min".\n    *   `"messages"`: an array containing two messages:\n        *   A system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL.\n        *   A user message containing the text: "N PlxDC6t EXYmclF c k e xTxtPjUdLx 6H LTa YQzK".\n8.  **Button:** A "Check" button is visible below the JSON data block.\n9. **LLM Token Cost:** At the bottom there is an indicator "LLM Token Cost (0.75 marks)."\n\n**Overall Context:** The screenshot likely depicts a task within a data science or machine learning course/assessment where the user needs to interact with an LLM API to perform sentiment analysis.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
