## Notebooks: Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that's become indispensable for data scientists and ML practitioners. It's particularly valuable because it provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, and for easy sharing of code and execution results.

While Colab is excellent for prototyping and learning, its free tier has limitations - notebooks time out after 12 hours, and GPU access can be inconsistent.

Learn how to mount Google Drive for persistent storage, manage dependencies with `!pip install` commands, as these are common pain points when getting started.

[Get started with Google Colaboratory (3 min): Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image appears to be a promotional or introductory graphic for a tutorial or course on Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Person:** A man with short brown hair and a warm smile is visible on the right side of the image. He is wearing a light blue button-down shirt.\n* **Text:** The words "Intro to Google Colab" are prominently displayed on the left side of the image in a bold, orange font.\n* **Logo:** Below the text, a circular logo with a stylized orange flower or starburst graphic and the text “Coding TensorFlow” is present.\n* **Background:** A light gray background features a delicate network of connected dots and lines, resembling a neural network or data connection.\n* **Color Scheme:** The image utilizes a color palette of light gray, orange, and blue, which is bright and inviting.\n\n**In summary**, this is likely a visual for an educational video or course about using Google Colab for TensorFlow coding, featuring an instructor and emphasizing the tool’s connection to data and machine learning.](https://youtu.be_inN8seMm7UI)
