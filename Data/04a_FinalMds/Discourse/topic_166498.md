Post:  Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited  :stuck_out_tongue: 
 Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important -  the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to  @s.anand (/u/s.anand) @s.anand  and the entire course team who designed this amazing course 
 I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next  :slight_smile:

This image shows a developer's coding setup in a Python IDE (file named "Wiki Outline Api.py"). The code fetches Wikipedia pages using requests and BeautifulSoup. ChatGPT is visible on the left, discussing refining this solution by handling SSL configurations via `os.environ.get('PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY', '0')` to address a common `ModuleNotFoundError`.
