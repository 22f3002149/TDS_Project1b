This screenshot shows an OpenRefine session processing a large dataset (over 400 rows visible). A table displays business information with columns including `case_id`, `trade_nm`, `legal_name`, addresses, and industry codes. The user is actively employing facet/filtering tools in the sidebar to analyze and refine specific data entries like "365 Electrician" or "LANDIS AGER", demonstrating OpenRefine's capabilities for handling messy data through filtering and transformation features accessible within a browser interface.

This session covers the use of OpenRefine for data cleaning, focusing on resolving entity discrepancies:

- **Data Upload and Project Creation**: Import data into OpenRefine and create a new project for analysis.
- **Faceting Data**: Use text facets to group similar entries and identify frequency of address crumbs.
- **Clustering Methodology**: Apply clustering algorithms to merge similar entries with minor differences, such as punctuation.
- **Manual and Automated Clustering**: Learn to merge clusters manually or in one go, trusting the system's clustering accuracy.
- **Entity Resolution**: Clean and save the data by resolving multiple versions of the same entity using Open Refine.
