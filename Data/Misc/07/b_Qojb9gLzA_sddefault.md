This Tableau screenshot displays a horizontal bar chart visualizing the Stringency Index across various locations like Afghanistan and Albania. The center pane shows varying bar heights representing index values up to 40K. Organized data panels list tables ('Date', 'Reduced master') and measures ('Location', 'New Cases', etc.). Visible tabs include standard Tableau options, a bottom bar indicates sheet details (137 marks) and ambient temperature. A small video conference icon adds context but focuses primarily on analyzing government response stringency levels for public health situations.
