# Google Sheets Access Request Interface

This image shows a typical access-denied screen in Google Sheets. The green header identifies the application, while the central blue button allows users to request access. Below it, an optional message field provides space for user notes.

The key visual elements include:
*   A light beige background.
*   Stacked blocks on the right illustrate restricted access metaphorically.
*   The bottom displays the current account information (`22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`), framed by a blue icon.
