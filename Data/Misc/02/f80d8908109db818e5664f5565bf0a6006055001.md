This image shows Python code performing sentiment analysis using OpenAI's API. It imports `json` and `httpx`, defines variables for the URL, headers, and data payload (including the GPT-4o-mini model), includes error handling with a try-except block, and prints an output value from a dummy response dictionary named `my_response`.
