This image shows a screenshot of OpenAI's pricing page comparing **GPT-4o** and its smaller counterpart, **GPT-4o mini**, both offering 128k context length. Key details include: GPT-4o costs $2.50/1M input tokens (with cached input cheaper), while output is priced at $10.00/1M tokens. In contrast, GPT-4o mini has much lower prices ($0.150 and $0.600 respectively). Other visible elements are the URL `openai.com/api/pricing`, a "Log in" button, navigation options on the left ("on", "rum"), and an "Ask ChatGPT" prompt at the bottom.
