The code appears to be related to fetching and parsing content from Wikipedia.\n\n**Code Editor Details:**\n\n*   **Code:** The visible code snippet includes comments indicating the purpose of fetching a Wikipedia page and generating a Markdown outline. It involves using the `requests` library to fetch the page and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content.\n*   **File Name:** The file is named "Wiki Outline Api.py".\n*   **File Path:** The code is located within a directory structure related to the "starlette" and "concurrency" packages (likely Python libraries).\n*   **Console Output:** A console panel at the bottom shows a series of file paths related to the "starlette" package during import, followed by "Run successfully".\n\n**ChatGPT Interface (Left Side):**\n\n*   **Conversation:** The chat interface shows a conversation between the user and ChatGPT.\n*   **User Prompt:** The user prompted ChatGPT to refine a solution.\n*   **ChatGPT Response:** ChatGPT responded with an update to handle SSL configurations, by including a workaround for SSL configuration and checking the "PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY" environment variable.\n*   **Error Message:** The user then reported a "ModuleNotFoundError" for the "ssl" module.\n\n**In summary,** the image captures a data analyst or developer working on a Python script to fetch Wikipedia content, receiving assistance from ChatGPT, and encountering a module import issue.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
