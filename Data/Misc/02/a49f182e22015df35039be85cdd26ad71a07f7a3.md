This screenshot shows a Python script failing while generating a credit card image. The primary error is an `OSError: cannot open resource`, specifically related to loading fonts using the PIL library, with `arial.ttf` at size 60 being involved. Tracebacks point to errors occurring in `/tmp/datagen6arsl.py` starting around line 220 and again during exception handling at line 303. The script also installed three packages previously.
