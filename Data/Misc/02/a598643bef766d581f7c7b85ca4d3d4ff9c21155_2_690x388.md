This image depicts a data scientist working within VS Code, tackling multiple web development sub-tasks (including embeddings, point regions, pathfinding, and correlations). One task specifically involves writing a FastAPI proxy server to fetch data from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/documents?q=london`, requiring CORS headers. The Thunder Client extension is shown testing this API call directly, displaying its JSON response ("div" element styled) with status code 200 OK and recent history timestamps.
