This image shows an assistant navigating the terminal on 'DESKTOP-89FBVHS' via MINGW64. After initially being in '~/', they change directory using `cd hello_world`. Attempting to list 'Dockerfile' details with `ls -l` first fails due to a "command not found" error, but upon retry it succeeds, displaying the file's permissions (-rw-r--r--), owner (hsent), size (~193KB), and last modified date.
