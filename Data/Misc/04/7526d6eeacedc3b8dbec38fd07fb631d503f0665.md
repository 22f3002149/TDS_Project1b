This image shows a screenshot quiz interface testing spreadsheet formula knowledge using Google Sheets and Excel. Two distinct questions feature complex formulas specific to each platform: one uses `SEQUENCE` and won't work in Excel, while the other requires Office 365 for compatibility with functions like `SORTBY`. The user must input answers and click "Check".
