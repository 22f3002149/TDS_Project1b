The background is dark, likely a dark green or black, and text is displayed in a lighter color for contrast.\n\n**Content Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Heading:** The top line states "5. Enabling CORS: Configure the web application to include appropriate CORS headers, allowing GET requests from any origin." This suggests the lesson or test topic is about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).\n2.  **Question:** "What is the URL of your API endpoint?" is displayed, indicating a prompt for user input.\n3.  **Input Field & Answer:** An input field contains the text "http://127.0.0.1:8000". To the right of the field, a green checkmark indicates that the answer has been accepted as correct.\n4.  **Confirmation Text:** Under the input field is the text "Correct".\n5.  **Instructional Text:** The next line reads "We\'ll check by sending a request to this URL ?country=... passing different countries." This describes how the answer will be validated.\n6.  **Button:** At the bottom left of the screen is a bright blue rectangular button labeled "Check". This button is presumably used to submit the answer and trigger the validation process.\n\n**In summary:** The image shows a step in a tutorial or test related to CORS configuration. A user has correctly entered the API endpoint URL, and the interface is now ready to move on to a validation step using different country parameters.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
