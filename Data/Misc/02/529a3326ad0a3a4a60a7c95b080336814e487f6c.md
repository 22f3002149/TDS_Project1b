This terminal image depicts a standard Linux/Unix command-line session. It displays text primarily against a black background using blue and green shades (blue for normal names, green for specific directories like 'init'). The prompt shows the current user ('vkovalchuk') and directory ('/mnt/c/IT_Hadara/TDS_Project'), listing common OS directories such as 'bin', 'etc', 'home', etc., with a blinking cursor at the end indicating an input point.
