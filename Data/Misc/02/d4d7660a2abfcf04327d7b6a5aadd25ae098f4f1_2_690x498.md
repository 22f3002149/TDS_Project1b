This screenshot shows a developer debugging a FastAPI application designed to fetch Wikipedia content and generate Markdown outlines.

The main issue is CORS errors when accessing local API endpoints (`http://localhost:8000/api/outline` with `?country=...` parameters).

Developer tools indicate blocked network requests from scripts like `exam.js`, `main.js`, suggesting the CORS configuration may not be properly set.
