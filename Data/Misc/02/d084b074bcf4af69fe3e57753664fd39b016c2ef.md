This screenshot shows a VS Code editor focused on Python, likely for a FastAPI application project named 'Glagow'. The visible `main.py` code defines a basic FastAPI instance with an endpoint returning "LLM-based Automation Agent is Running!". A terminal at the bottom displays output from a `pip install` command installing required packages like `fastapi`, `uvicorn`. The file structure includes directories for tasks, data, and files such as `database.py`, suggesting Docker integration via a `docker-compose.yml` file.
