[Jolie No. 1: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:** The image is a split-screen media graphic discussing Bollywood actor Govinda and the movie "Avatar."\n\n**Left Side:**\n* **Subject:** Bollywood actor Govinda is seated in what appears to be a television studio or interview setting.\n* **Appearance:** He is wearing a black jacket over an orange shirt. He has short, styled hair and appears to be looking directly at the viewer/camera.\n* **Background:** The background is a textured, gold-colored wall.\n* **Logo:** A logo for "INDIA" with a website address (indiatvnews.co) is visible in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Right Side:**\n* **Subject:** A digitally altered image of Govinda\'s face superimposed onto a Na\'vi character from the movie "Avatar." \n* **Appearance:** The face is blue with the typical Na\'vi facial features (pointed ears, wide eyes, and facial markings). It is a humorous portrayal suggesting Govinda "as" an Avatar character.\n\n**Text Overlay:**\n* **Top:** Text reads "GOVINDA DECLINES \'AVATAR\' FILM BY JAMES CAMERON."\n* **Below:** A sub-headline states "Claims he suggested the title".\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a media graphic used to report on Govinda\'s claim that he originally suggested the title "Avatar" to James Cameron, implying that the film director may have used the name without giving him credit. The graphic combines the actor\'s portrait with a comedic alteration to visually convey the news item.](https://youtu.be_lcwMsPxPIjc)
