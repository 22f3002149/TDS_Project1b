This image shows a Vercel deployment attempt for a Python application. It includes instructions to download `vercel-python.json` and deploy via API endpoints with specified data (`marks`: 10, 20). Crucially, it highlights an error ("Failed to Fetch") at the URL `https://tdsproject1-tdsjpn1-3t20038s3-projects.vercel.app/api`, suggesting a CORS issue might be preventing GET requests from succeeding.
