This image shows the **Dockerfile** contents within a GitHub repository interface.

The file specifies using `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` as its base, installs dependencies via apt-get and pip (including the package manager 'uv'), sets the working directory to `/app`, copies application code ('app.py') into it, and explicitly uses '/root/.local/bin/uv' before running the application with `CMD`. The current user is identified as "GauraVinDex".
