This image shows an online coding interface tasking a user with writing an SQL query. The prompt asks to calculate the total sales (Units * Price) from the 'tickets' table where the ticket `TYPE` field exactly matches 'Gold'. However, the submitted code `SELECT SUM(Units*Price) FROM tickets WHERE TYPE = 'Gold';` includes an error message `(1428105)` and fails to account for case sensitivity or spaces in the instructions.
