Post:  @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton  Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise. 
 Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

# Google Sheets Access Request Interface

This image shows a typical access-denied screen in Google Sheets. The green header identifies the application, while the central blue button allows users to request access. Below it, an optional message field provides space for user notes.

The key visual elements include:
*   A light beige background.
*   Stacked blocks on the right illustrate restricted access metaphorically.
*   The bottom displays the current account information (`22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`), framed by a blue icon.

 Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

Here is a concise summary of the instructions:

The image shows two key steps for submitting work: first, create a new blank Google Sheet workbook named "ga.7.1.rollno" (replace rollno with your IITM ID). Second, share editing rights to the specific email address se2002@study.iitm.ac.in, ensuring this sharing is done *before* starting on the blank sheet.
