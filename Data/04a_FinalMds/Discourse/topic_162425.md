This is a screenshot from a Data Science tools webpage course platform with a dark theme and orange/yellow text highlights. The sidebar lists main course sections like development/deployment/Large Language Models (LLMs). The central "Course Links" area provides general resources such as forums, handbooks, and the public course page. A separate section titled "Jan 2025 Links" offers specific materials including a grading document, calendar, announcements, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and TA session videos.
