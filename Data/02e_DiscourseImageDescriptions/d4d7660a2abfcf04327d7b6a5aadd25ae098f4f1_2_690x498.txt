API Development (choosing a framework like FastAPI).\n        2.  Fetching Wikipedia Content.\n        3.  Extracting Headings.\n        4.  Generating Markdown Outline.\n        5.  Enabling CORS.\n    *   A text field with the URL of the API endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/outline` \n    *   A "TypeError: Load failed" message displayed next to the URL, indicating an issue with loading the resource.\n    *   A call to action: "We\'ll check by sending a request to this URL with ?country=... passing different countries." \n    *   A button labeled "Check".\n\n2.  **Developer Tools Console (Bottom Section):**\n    *   A screen capture of a browser\'s developer tools console.\n    *   Numerous error messages and logs are visible, indicating network requests being blocked.\n    *   Many of the error messages relate to blocked requests from `exam.js`,  `main.js`, and `sandworkers.dev`. \n    *   The logs contain details about failed fetch requests to the same API endpoint (`http://localhost:8000/api/outline?country=The+Bahamas`) as in the top section. \n    *   The errors suggest a problem with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) or network access.\n\n**In Summary:** The screenshot depicts a developer working on a web application that fetches content from Wikipedia and generates a Markdown outline.  The application is encountering errors related to loading the API endpoint, likely due to CORS issues or blocked network requests. The developer is trying to debug the application by sending requests with different country parameters.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
