This image shows a coding environment attempting to connect to a locally hosted FastAPI application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api. A red highlight indicates the tested URL, with error messages "TypeError: Load failed" suggesting issues accessing the API data, despite CORS allowing GET requests. The plan is to add "?class=..." and verify the response.
