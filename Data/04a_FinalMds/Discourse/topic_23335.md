Post:  @carlton (/u/carlton) @carlton  I was trying to view a session, but since youtube is very distracting I tried to embed it on a site, but it throws this error

# Image Description: Video Unavailable Notification

This image shows a black screen displaying a white notification centered at the top-left. Inside a white circle is an exclamation mark; below it reads "Video unavailable. Playback on other websites has been disabled by the video owner. Watch on YouTube". A small, white YouTube play button icon sits in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

 Video I am trying to watch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H5Aq7HjqwQ) Video I am trying to watch 
 If possible, please fix this since the youtube as a platform is distracting and has many ads, even though the channel is not monitized.

 I will have to get authorisation from the operations to allow embedding you tube videos. This was a deliberate choice as the content is strictly speaking owned by IITM. Embeddings may allow others to monetise content without the appropriate permissions. 
 I will enquire on your behalf. I accept that not every channel follows the directives properly, so you might find it possible to embed other channel videos from IITM, but I can only go by the agreed upon protocols. 
 I know that’s not much comfort, but if its possible, I will amend the permissions. 
 Kind regards

 I can’t personally think of any way one can do this, but it’s completely upto to the operations team. 
 I ask for this permission as youtube can be quite distracting and getting rid of advertisements either require an adblocker that cause some trouble once in 2 weeks, even though they don’t turn of recommendations and hence the procrastination. Embedding is another way which can stop the recommendations and the advertisements. 
 Hope to hear soon, 
Regards
