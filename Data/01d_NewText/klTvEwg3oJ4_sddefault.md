This retro 80s promotional graphic playfully merges Rick Astley's likeness (running) with the technical phrase "vector DATABASE RACE". Using a blocky, white font for "vector" and bold red angled text for "RACE", it highlights the topic on a black background alongside a speed symbol. The bottom corner features "THE CODE REPORT" logo within a black box, suggesting an allusion to the internet's "Rickroll" meme makes this technical subject more engaging and accessible.
