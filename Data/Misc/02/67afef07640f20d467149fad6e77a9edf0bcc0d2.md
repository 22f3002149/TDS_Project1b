This image shows a Python script counting Wednesdays between August 9, 1986, and June 19, 2012. The code uses `datetime` to define start/end dates, then loops through each day checking if the weekday is `(start_date + i).weekday() == 2`. It successfully returns a count of **1349** Wednesdays shown in terminal output (casting.py).
