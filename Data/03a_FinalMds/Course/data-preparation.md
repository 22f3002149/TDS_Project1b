# Data Preparation

Data preparation is crucial because raw data is rarely perfect.

It often contains errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. For example, marks data may have 'NA' or 'absent' for non-attendees, which you need to handle.

This section teaches you how to clean up data, convert it to different formats, aggregate it if required, and get a feel for the data before you analyze.

[Data Preparation - Introduction: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a spreadsheet or table. It appears to be a data set related to numerical values associated with different locations or labels in columns and years in rows. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Header Row:** The first row (labeled 4-N) denotes column headers likely representing years (1957, 1962, 1967, etc.) up to 2013.\n* **Row Labels:** The leftmost column (labeled "Row Labels") lists place names or identifiers: Afzalpur, Aland, Alland, Anekal, Ankola, Arabhavi, Arkaligud, Arsikere, Athani, Athni, Aural, B.T.M. Layout, Babaleshwar, Badami, Bagalkot, Begepalli, Begewadi, Bailhongal, and so on.\n* **Data Values:** The cells within the table contain numerical values, presumably representing data points related to the specified location and year. The numbers vary significantly.\n* **Text at Top:** At the top of the image, there\'s a phrase: "At this point, we start checking what\'s gone wrong." This suggests that the table is part of an analysis or error-checking process.\n* **Image on Right:** There\'s a small, somewhat distorted image on the right side of the table depicting a cartoonish figure with exaggerated features, appearing angry or frustrated.\n\n**Overall, the image appears to be a snapshot of a data table used for statistical analysis or monitoring, with a note indicating an investigative process and a humorous visual element.**](https://youtu.be_dF3zchJJKqk)
