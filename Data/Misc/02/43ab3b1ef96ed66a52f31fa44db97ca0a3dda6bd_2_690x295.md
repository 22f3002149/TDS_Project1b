This image shows a Google Form asking for specific details about Project 27. The first question requests the GitHub repository link (e.g., https://github.com/itskaiffazal/tdsproject2). The second asks for an API endpoint URL, noting POST requests will be sent there (e.g., https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/). It appears designed to systematically collect code and technical information.
