This image shows a developer's GitHub workspace configuring a Python application in a "Dockerfile". The interface displays project directories (main, data) alongside files like app.py and datagen.py. Key commands include `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm`, installing dependencies with `pip install`, copying files, exposing a port, and setting the start command (`CMD`). A notification highlights GitHub Copilot's availability for faster coding.
