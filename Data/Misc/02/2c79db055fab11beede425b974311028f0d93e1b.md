# Project Prerequisites Check

The image shows an automated system's assessment of four project prerequisites: public Docker image (FAIL), GitHub repository (PASS), root Dockerfile (PASS), and MIT license (PASS). Despite passing three checks, the overall "Prerequisites" summary is a FAIL due to the missing or inaccessible Docker image. The evaluation result for Project 1 is consequently zero points.
