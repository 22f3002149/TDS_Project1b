 Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it? 
  (#p-602891-how-6) How? 
 
 If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work 
 If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful  :+1:t3: :+1:t3:

# Requested format
## Student Assignments Directory Structure

Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
- A `.txt` file with the question statement.
- A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.

### Example Directory Structure
RollNo_12345/
