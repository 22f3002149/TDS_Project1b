The interface is dark-themed.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n*   **Repository Information:**\n    *   Repository name: "pscodes24/dataworks-agent"\n    *   Last pushed: approximately 1 month ago\n    *   Repository size: 490.1 MB\n*   **Tabs:** A navigation bar with tabs for "General", "Tags", "Image Management" (currently selected), "Collaborators", "Webhooks", and "Settings".\n*   **Search Bar:**  A search bar for filtering images by tag or digest.\n*   **Image List:** A table listing the images within the repository. Columns include:\n    *   **Digest:** The unique identifier for each image layer.\n    *   **Tags:**  Tags associated with each image (e.g., "latest").\n    *   **Media Type:** Indicates the image is of type "Image".\n    *   **OS/ARCH:** Operating system and architecture ("linux/amd64").\n    *   **Size:** The size of each image layer (e.g., 273.5 MB, 262.3 MB).\n    *   **Last Pushed:** Timestamp indicating when the layer was last pushed.\n    *   **Last Pulled**: Timestamp indicating when the layer was last pulled.\n*   **Docker Command Snippet:** A section on the right provides example Docker commands for pushing new tags to the repository.\n*   **Pagination:** Pagination controls (1-2 of 2) at the bottom suggesting there might be more images than displayed.\n\n**Visual Details:**\n\n*   The interface uses a dark background with light-colored text and table elements.\n*   Checkboxes are present beside each image digest, presumably for selecting layers.\n*   "BETA" is labeled on the "Image Management" tab.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the image provides a snapshot of the image management interface within a container registry, allowing a user to view and manage the layers that make up their container image.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
