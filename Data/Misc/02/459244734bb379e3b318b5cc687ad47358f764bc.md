# Email Regarding Project 1 Prerequisites

This email details prerequisite checks for **Project 1** in a TDS course (likely data science). It requires: GitHub repo present and public, MIT license at root, valid Dockerfile at root, and a public Docker image.

The learner's results show failures on the *GitHub repo presence check* (missing) and *Dockerfile present in root*. Despite passing other checks including MIT license, these critical failures resulted in an overall **Prerequisites: FAIL** status with a Project 1 Score of **0**.
