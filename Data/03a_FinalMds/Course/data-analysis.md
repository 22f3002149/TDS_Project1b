Once you've prepared the data, your next task is to analyze it to get insights that are not immediately obvious.

In this module, you'll learn:

- **Statistical analysis**: Calculate correlations, regressions, forecasts, and outliers using **spreadsheets**
- **Data summarization**: Aggregate and pivot data using **Python** and **databases**.
- **Geo-data Collection & Processing**: Gather and process geospatial data using tools like Python (GeoPandas) and QGIS.
- **Geo-visualization**: Create and visualize geospatial data on maps using Excel, QGIS, and Python libraries such as Folium.
- **Network & Proximity Analysis**: Analyze geospatial relationships and perform network analysis to understand data distribution and clustering.
- **Storytelling & Decision Making**: Develop narratives and make informed decisions based on geospatial data insights.

[Data Analysis - Introduction: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a slide from a presentation, likely related to data analysis techniques. The slide highlights various methods used to "Model the data," categorizing them based on the software used (Excel, Python, and "Others").\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Title:** At the top center, the title "Model the data" is displayed in white text.\n* **Categorization:** The slide is divided into three sections:\n * **Excel:** Listed below are the techniques achievable in Excel: Correlation, Regression, and Outlier detection.\n * **Python:** Techniques achievable in Python include: Classification, Forecasting, and Clustering.\n * **Others:** A third section simply labeled "Others."\n* **Visual Style:** The slide uses a dark purple background with rectangular blocks for headings and text. The text is predominantly white.\n* **Bottom Right:** In the bottom right corner of the image is a small circular portrait of a person. \n\n**In essence, the image is a comparative chart outlining data modeling techniques and their association with different software tools.**](https://youtu.be_CRSljunxjnk)
