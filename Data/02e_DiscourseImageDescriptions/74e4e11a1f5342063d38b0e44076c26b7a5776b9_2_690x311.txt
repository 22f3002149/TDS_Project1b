It has a dark green background and features text-based instructions and input fields.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n*   **Timestamp:** "Tue Feb 2, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" displayed in the top left corner.\n*   **Score:** "Score: 8/10" indicates progress on the challenge. Buttons "Check" and "Save" are visible.\n*   **Instructions:** The main section presents a task:\n    *   Download a file called "q-vercel-python.json" containing marks of 100 students.\n    *   Deploy a Python app to Vercel and expose an API endpoint that accepts requests like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`.\n    *   The API should return a JSON response with the marks for students X and Y (example: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`).\n    *   Instructions to enable CORS for GET requests from any origin.\n*   **Input Field:** There is a field where a Vercel URL is expected.\n*   **User Input:** "https://vercel-project-three-liard.vercel.app/api" is entered in the input field.\n*   **Error Message:** "Error: Expected [35,71,83,96,95] but got [null,null,null,null]" indicates the user\'s implementation is not returning the expected results.\n\n**In essence, the image shows a coding problem involving API deployment, JSON processing, and error handling.**', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
