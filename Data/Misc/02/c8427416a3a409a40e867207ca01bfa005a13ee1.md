This image shows an error message from a GitHub Actions test for the repository `https://github.com/22300058/tds_project-1_git`. The submission "failed" because two requirements were not met: no file named 'LICENSE' was present, specifically missing an MIT license, and there was no Dockerfile included in the project.
