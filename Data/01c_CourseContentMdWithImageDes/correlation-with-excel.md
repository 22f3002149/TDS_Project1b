## Correlation with Excel

[Correlation with Excel: Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with data visualization. It appears to be an analysis of COVID-19 data, likely tracking new cases, deaths, and vaccinations in Brazil. \n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n* **Spreadsheet Layout:** A standard Excel grid is visible, containing rows and columns of numerical data.\n* **Data Columns:** The columns contain data labeled: \n * "Date" (Column A) - Dates formatted as DD-MM-YY.\n * "Country" (Column B) - All entries are "BRA" (Brazil).\n * "New Cases" (Column C)\n * "New Deaths" (Column D)\n * "Cumulative Cases" (Column E)\n * "Cumulative Deaths" (Column F)\n * "Cumulative Vaccinations" (Column G)\n* **Data Range:** The data appears to span from approximately February 19, 2021, to March 29, 2021.\n* **Scatter Plot:** A scatter plot is embedded within the spreadsheet. The x-axis represents "new_cases" (new cases), and the y-axis represents "new_deaths" (new deaths). The plot shows a dense cluster of blue dots, indicating a positive correlation between new cases and new deaths.\n* **Trendline:** A black trendline is overlaid on the scatter plot, visually representing the relationship between new cases and new deaths.\n* **Excel Interface:** The Excel ribbon is visible at the top, with options like "File," "Home," "Insert," "Data," etc. The "Format Trendline" options box is open on the right, with options to adjust color, type, etc. of the trendline.\n* **Zoom Level:** The spreadsheet is zoomed out, showing a large amount of data at once.\n* **Formula Bar:** The formula bar is visible below the ribbon and contains a formula relating to "new vaccinations".](https://youtu.be_lXHCyhO7DmY)
