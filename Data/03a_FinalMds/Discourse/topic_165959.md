Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:** The image displays a snippet of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data alongside an error message.\n\n**JSON Data:**\n* The JSON object contains four key-value pairs:\n * `"id": "tt7144296"`: The ID is "tt7144296".\n * `"title": "1. Kiss and Kill"`: The title is "1. Kiss and Kill".\n * `"year": 2017`: The year is 2017.\n * `"rating": 2.9`: The rating is 2.9.\n* The object is not fully complete, missing a closing curly brace for the object.\n\n**Error Message:**\n* Below the JSON data, there\'s a text-based error message: "Error: Expected: 2.9 Actual: 2.9". This indicates an assertion or comparison failed, as the expected value (2.9) matches the actual value (2.9).\n\n**Background:** The background is black, making the white text and JSON data easily visible.\n\n**Context:** The image likely comes from a software testing or data validation scenario where JSON data is being parsed and checked against expected values.Screenshot 2025-02-01 132301331×314 12.3 KB
what is the error here?? sir @Jivraj
I have the Same doubt.
@22f3001315 @21f3002277 @24ds2000024 – please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this:
Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4

FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.
In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?
edit:  This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?
@23f2000237 A good point. Yes, please include all titles. I’ve reworded the question accordingly. Thanks.
Q3. How to handle the error ? @Jivraj

I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10?
(Assuming they have interacted in this thread)
Anyone scoring 10/10 on GA4 and replying with a relevant message on this thread will get 11/10 
For me I just made filter of rating between 2 and 7 in site and typed in console as per  video. with that data got in console worked fine.
copy the coding and save in place use it for data extract when finally submit

how to get the BBC weather API key?
Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.
Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?
@JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.

@Jivraj can help me to fix the issue
Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository)
Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any error

Here\'s a point-by-point description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a text-based instruction set, likely from a software or web application interface.\n* **Instructions:** The instructions detail steps to be taken "after creating the workflow", specifically:\n * Triggering the workflow and waiting for completion.\n * Ensuring it appears as the most recent action in the repository.\n * Verifying a commit is created during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run.\n* **Input Field:** There is an input field labeled "Enter your repository URL (format: https://github.com/USER/REPO)".\n* **URL Provided:** The URL "https://github.com/23f2603853/workflows" is present within the input field.\n* **Error Message:** An error message is visible below the input field: "XML Parse Error: Implicit keys need to be on a single line at line 1, column 1. ". This suggests the system attempted to parse the provided URL as XML and failed.\n* **Format:** The text is in a clear, readable font with bullet points for the instructions, and the error message is highlighted in red.\n* **Context:** This appears to be part of a workflow configuration or setup process, likely related to GitHub Actions or similar automation tools.\n\n\n\nimage602×135 24.8 KB
I removed the directory and submitted the same url I got the following error
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image shows a user interface element, likely a web form or input field, with an error message.\n* **Input Field:** A text input field is present, populated with the URL "https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows".

@Jivraj @carlton
Hi Tushar,
If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.
kind regards

In ques 4 Scrap the BBC Weather API,
I scraped the locationId for my city (i.e Mumbai)
and post that also mapped each issueDate to its corresponding enhancedWeatherDescription .
The sample output mentioned was:
The output would look like this:

  "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
  "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies",
  // ... additional days
}

And My Output after scraping (And as explained by professor in Video 2 BBC weather was)
{
“2025-02-05”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-06”: “A clear sky and light winds”,

“2025-02-19”: “A clear sky and light winds”
}
But it’s giving Error::
Error: At root: Different number of properties
Can you please help how to fix this issue.
Issue resolved for me after following below step
After creating the workflow:

Trigger the workflow and wait for it to complete
Ensure it appears as the most recent action in your repository
Verify that it creates a commit during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run

In place of “name: Setup up GIT config” change to “name: add commit {your_email}”
use this Google Colab with the city name to get the Json Body just change the date format.

In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown content but it was incorrect all the time.
I have tried these steps:
import pymupdf4llm
md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")

import pathlib
pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())

Then i run this in bash
prettier --write output.md

And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups, and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw the preview, it does matches with the pdf.
# Can someone please advise me a better approach?
hey, can you help me in doing this i can’t able to do this.

sir in the weather question could you provide from where do we get the bbc api because i have searched a lot and havent been able to find it
https://tds.s-anand.net/#/bbc-weather-api-with-python
try manually inspecting the output of the api and compare it with your script output.
Or else try refreshing the browser and check.

Previously i got correct on q2 but now i am getting the error when i refresh the page “TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading ‘textContent’)”
Please try city=“Mumbai” as a string literal.

@Jivraj @carlton can you please explain the reason for this error
Hi Mishkat
Please refer to this post.




GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science


@JoelJeffrey 
We will be changing this question. Even we found it pretty hard  
Kind regards
  

Kind regards
@s.anand Sir the question 10 of the Graded Assignment 4 is very tough I have tried everything from custom python codes using different libraries to online converted and also formatted using prettier. Please sir guide me how to do the question.
Yep figured that, and after matching the data solved the error and got that question correct.
Though thank you.
@s.anand Sir I have done the question 2 of the graded assignment but I am very curious to know why the answers language gets periodically change. Is there some kind of backend code which is responsible for that or is something else ?
Yes we’ll were facing this issue.
@carlton sir mentioned yesterday that they will change the question.
"We will be changing this question. Even we found it hard 
Kind regards"
So need to worry about that question for now.
OK, that is good to hear, you won’t believe that yesterday I was trying this question for 2 hours literally, it can be more also.
I was stuck at that question for 2 days, I tried multiple ways but was not able to format the content with prettier as expected, every time I was getting the error “Incorrect. Try again.”
On popular demand, I’ve made Q10 of GA4 easier (converting from PDF to Markdown). The question remains the same, but the check is more liberal and the error messages are more helpful. Please give it a shot now.
(FYI, one person did solve it. A colleague, not someone from the IITM DS program.)
Hello Sir, i tried but unfortunately after extracting the contents and formatting the contents and submitting it, it’s showing various errors like Missing links, Missing tables…
But on checking the file i wasn’t able to find any single table in the contents in that case what could be done to fix these errors?
@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini
same issue with me as well
Sir I checked the pdf file, there is only one place unorder list is given and the same is available in my answer. But the system throws error Missing List (I tried with other symbols * and + also) . Please inform me where I made mistake

I checked many times. For me it says “Incorrect. Try again.”
Ya i know, i added tables, list, blockquote, code, tables have all been added still it’s showing errors. Not sure where am I going wrong.
Please refer video and document relating to Question 1 of Assignment 3. There it is mentioned how to mark bold, table etc., use those marks
I have added all those and pasted the markdown and it appears as above.

Below is the screenshot of provided PDF. That font colour strains my eyes. Any particular reason for that PDF?
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a screen capture of what appears to be a text-heavy webpage or document. It\'s filled with lines of Latin text.\n* **Text Format:** The text is presented in a continuous flow, resembling a paragraph or a series of sentences. There are some bullet points interspersed within the text.\n* **Color Scheme:** The background is a very pale, almost white, shade of green. The text itself is dark, likely black or a very dark grey, providing high contrast.\n* **Text Characteristics:** The text is in a standard serif font, typical for body text. The font size is relatively small, and the lines are closely spaced.\n* **Highlighted Sections**: Some phrases, such as "crescovito" and "depraedor" are hyperlinked, indicated by the underline. \n* **Overall Impression:** The image has a scholarly or historical feel due to the use of Latin text and the classic font. It’s likely a snippet from an academic document, a digital library, or a website dedicated to Latin literature.image541×439 20.9 KB
I am getting missing link error. I checked in the pdf file also, the blue color text seems a link but its not clickable.
Any suggestion to move nearer to the actual solution.
You may try like this: cresco vomito

Even I’m getting a similar error in Q2, it is expecting a foreign title whereas my search result gives only English titles.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a snippet of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, likely from a code editor or similar environment. There\'s also an error message visible at the bottom.\n\n**Specific details:**\n\n* **JSON Data:** The JSON data is structured with key-value pairs. The keys include:\n * `"id"`: with the value `"v8712204"`\n * `"title"`: with the value `"25. Batwoman"`\n * `"year"`: with the value `"2019-2022"`\n * `"rating"`: with the value `"3.6"`\n* **Error Message:** There\'s a red error message at the bottom that reads: "Error: At [12], title Values don’t match. Expected “13. Pideme lo que quieras”. Actual “13. Ask Me What You Want”"\n* **Background:** The background is a light gray, typical of many code editor interfaces.\n* **Interface elements:** The JSON data is contained within a rectangular box outlined in red.image1614×250 14.4 KB
Please help.
I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.
Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.
A post was merged into an existing topic: Tds: assignment is not submitting
your last saved score (i.e.6 of your’s) will be official score and forgot about seek portal , it is not meant for this type of assignment.
Thank you for the update! I gave Q10 another shot, and I was able to solve it this time. The more liberal checks and improved error messages made a big difference in understanding where I was going wrong.
Thank again.
Can we use hacking to get answers to some questions? Has anyone ever done it?
What format is required for the “missing links” here
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a web page displaying a text-based exercise or challenge related to converting PDF files to Markdown format. The background is dark, and text is primarily white.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Heading:** The top of the screen features the heading "Impact."\n* **Bullet Points:** Underneath "Impact" are four bullet points detailing the benefits of completing the exercise:\n * Enhances Productivity\n * Improves Quality\n * Supports Scalability\n * Facilitates Integration\n* **Question:** A question is displayed: "What is the markdown content of the PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?"\n* **Text Block:** Below the question is a block of Latin text, appearing to be the content of the PDF being referenced. The text includes phrases like "Audax teneo centum cilium vigor venio" and "Defessus pax volup vomito creator video campana cedo vita votum."\n* **Error Message:** A small red error message is visible near the text block, stating "Error: Missing links."\n* **Concluding Text:** At the bottom of the screen is a paragraph explaining that obtaining the correct Markdown output from a PDF is difficult and requires manual corrections. The exercise checks only a few basic things.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n* The page appears to be part of an educational or technical exercise, likely relating to document processing or automation.\n* The use of Latin text adds a unique element, potentially testing the ability to handle special characters or non-English content during conversion.\n\n\n\nimage1973×849 93.6 KB

In the pdf you see some blue color font for specific words write that word in format
[word](#)



There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.
All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as  link texts same as in pdf.

Link text
Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts,
below error is still observed.
Error: Missing links
Did anyone else face same issue ?

Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.
But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone.

Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.
Replace actual text to expected text until you got correct
same kind of error is arising with me too.Any suggestion what is wrong with it??
the rating should be treated as string.
Format is as “2.9” instead of number 2.9
Yes it can be done. Got the 10th one correct by implementing breakpoint by printing the expected answer which is being used to validate the user answer in the js script.

@21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a snippet of JSON data likely representing a weather forecast for São Paulo.\n* **JSON Structure:** The JSON appears to be a set of key-value pairs, with the keys being dates (e.g., "2025-02-08") and the values being textual weather descriptions (e.g., "Partly cloudy and light winds").\n* **Dates and Forecasts:** The dates range from February 8th to February 12th, 2025, with forecasts including "Partly cloudy and light winds", "Thundery showers and a gentle breeze", and "Sunny and a gentle breeze".\n* **Error Message:** A red-bordered error message appears below the JSON, stating "Error: At root: Property name mismatch". This suggests the provided JSON structure doesn\'t match what the application/system expects.\n* **User Interface Elements:** There\'s a text prompt at the top asking "What is the JSON weather forecast for Sao Paulo?". Below the JSON data is a blue button labeled "Check", likely used to validate the JSON.\n* **Overall Impression:** The image shows a user attempting to submit or process a JSON weather forecast, but encountering an error due to a mismatch in expected data structure.image716×402 23.3 KB
This is the only thing which worked for me.
@carlton Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB.  The current example on the portal is:
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a snippet of data, likely in a JSON format, representing information about movies.\n* **Data Structure:** It consists of an array of objects, each representing a movie.\n* **Movie Details:** Each movie object contains the following key-value pairs:\n * `"id"`: A unique identifier for the movie (e.g., "tt1234567").\n * `"title"`: The name of the movie (e.g., "Movie 1").\n * `"year"`: The year the movie was released (e.g., 2021).\n * `"rating"`: The rating the movie received (e.g., 5.8).\n* **Entries:** The image shows information for two movies:\n * Movie 1: ID "tt1234567", title "Movie 1", year "2021", rating "5.8".\n * Movie 2: ID "tt7654321", title "Movie 2", year "2019", rating "6.2".\n* **Ellipsis:** There is an ellipsis ("// ... more titles") indicating that the data set extends beyond these two entries.\n* **Background:** The background is black with light-colored text, typical of a code editor or console output.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a data snippet representing a list of movies with their IDs, titles, release years, and ratings.image1580×196 4.81 KB
Your dot of 2.9 may be the dot from alphabet or numeric one
Try to copy the value and then replace it
Try to copy the error data
The problem might be off dot
check one dot is on right of m and other right of 0 in keyboard
these two dots may represent different meanings
is it resolved?
i too am getting the same error,even if it was working fine yesterday.
https will be part of the link (provided ‘link’ is one of the checkpoints of evaluation)
Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 &gt;&gt; Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.
I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?
In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST.
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.
Good idea @23f2005138 and thanks. I fixed this. The example now reads:
[
  { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },
  { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" },

… with the year and ratings quoted.

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.
For the particular instance - “2024–”, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.
Thanks @21f2000709 for this information. I figure out where i made mistake. During writing console code I added to remove non numeric values in year field which i guess removed that hyphen (“–”). I will rectify that.
GA 4 Q2
My JSON matches the titles of the movies as in the website, but in portal it is showing error and expecting something different from what is given in the website. How to handle this ?
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image shows a promotional graphic for the horror film "Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey."\n* **Visual Elements:**\n * A poster of the movie is on the left, featuring a distressed, frightening image of Winnie-the-Pooh with a menacing expression and blood splatters.\n * The title of the movie "Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" is prominently displayed on the poster.\n * To the right of the poster, there is text listing the film\'s year of release (2023), runtime (1h 24m), and rating (Not Rated).\n * Below the release information are user ratings (2.9 from 33k) and a Metascore of 16.\n* **Overall Impression:** The image is designed to present information about the horror film. It combines the movie poster with key details like release year, runtime, and ratings.image501×151 37.6 KB
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image shows a snippet of error messaging related to JSON data comparison, likely from a software testing or data validation process.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1. **JSON Data Snippet:**\n * It displays a partial JSON object with the keys: "title," "year," and "rating."\n * The "title" is "25. Battlefield Earth".\n * The "year" is "2000".\n * The "rating" is "2.5".\n * The JSON snippet is enclosed within curly braces `{}` and has a structure suitable for representing data in a key-value pair format.\n\n2. **Error Message:**\n * The main content is an error message stating: "Error: At [1].title: Values don\'t match. Expected: "2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" Actual: "2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey"".\n * This message indicates a discrepancy between the expected value for the \'title\' field and the actual value found.\n * The error message specifies that the expected title is "2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" and the actual title is "2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey".\n\n3. **Highlighting:**\n * The expected title ("2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey") is highlighted with a red border.\n * The actual title ("2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey") is highlighted with a green border.\n\n**Context:** This image likely originates from a test run where data validation failed. The error suggests a mismatch in the \'title\' field between the expected and actual data, potentially indicating an issue in data processing or integration.image1226×258 13.2 KB
contradiction :
" 2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" (in web page) &amp; ( delivered by the JSON)
" 2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" (expected in portal ) &amp; ( raising error statement )

so just exchange it.
Thanks for your response.
Many such titles have contradiction from what is expected and what is there in the website. This case the samples are 25 your approach is accepted to some extent, but on a larger sample space, need to work it right !
thanks for this, was wondering why it wasn’t working!
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a screenshot of code/text, likely from a development or data analysis environment.\n* **Structure:** It is formatted as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object, containing key-value pairs.\n* **Data:**\n * The first JSON snippet shows a weather forecast for dates "2025-01-01", "2025-01-02", and "2025-01-03" with descriptions like "Sunny with scattered clouds" and "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain". It also indicates that there are "additional days" of data.\n * The second snippet displays weather information specifically for Kuala Lumpur on "2025-01-02", predicting "Thundery showers and light winds".\n* **Error Message:** Beneath the second JSON snippet, there is an error message: "Error: At root: Different number of properties." This indicates an issue with the structure of the data, possibly inconsistent formatting or missing fields.\n* **Visual Style:** The code is presented in a monospaced font, typical for code or data displays, with a dark background and green/white text for emphasis.\n\n\n\nquestion4692×539 36.3 KB

For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description. Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can then use to verify the date and description.
here is the difference of  ‘:’ in the expected ans. so make it manually correct . i did the same and got correct ans .
and in the question also it is mentioned that may be manually you need to correct.  just give a try.
run your console script again and match the description.
yes, same happened with me . correct it manually.

The example keys in the JSON are: date, and description.\n6. **Sample JSON:** Several example JSON entries (date & forecast) are present, for example: "2025-01-01": "Sunny and gentle breeze". \n7. **Button:** A button labeled "Check" is visible at the bottom of the image, likely for submitting the completed task.\n\n**Text & Formatting:**\n\n* The document uses standard headings, paragraphs, and bullet points for clarity.\n* Code snippets (JSON) are formatted with indentation for readability.\n* The text is generally clear and concise, focusing on the technical details of the task.\n\n**Overall, the image demonstrates a technical documentation piece for a data integration exercise, geared towards programmers or data analysts.**image1358×1151 179 KB
Why question 4 starts failing. It was working correct yesterday. Because of it I am getting 9/10 marks.
The result is dynamic with changes made in the API. So try re-executing your code today and it will automatically solve. Your code is right ! Just make a re-run and things will work out 
try running the console again and it will work, make sure the data matches with the one in api as it changes regularly
Thanks!.
It is working now. I had to manually correct 5 movie titles to get it correct.

What 's the solution?
Titles (from the output json) should be replaced by the titles which shows in the error message “Expected”. It can only be done manually. There may be multiple titles need to be translated by this method.
Please refer the instruction.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a message regarding IMDb search results.\n* **Text:** The text reads: "IMDb search results may differ by region. You may need to manually translate titles. Results may also change periodically. You may need to re-run your scraper code."\n* **Background:** The message is displayed against a light gray background.\n* **Button:** A blue button labeled "Check" is located below the text.\n* **Overall:** The image appears to be a notification or warning message from a web scraping application related to IMDb data.10000952401080×183 43.8 KB
you can manually add space after the hyphen
I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json outcome. Anyways the new json with same issueDate also gives the same Root error
Double-check that the rating field in the JSON is indeed a float (2.9) and not a string ("2.9") in your code.
That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method.
But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.
Write the code referencing the provided collab file and make sure to use the API key
The output actually changes once in a while so you might need to run the code a few times before getting in right

I am getting this error again and again after running the code in collab this city  Nur-Sultan?
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a Python error message displayed in an interactive coding environment (likely Jupyter Notebook or similar).\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Error Message:** The most prominent feature is the "NameError: name \'location\\_id\' is not defined" message. This indicates that the code attempts to use a variable named \'location\\_id\' before it has been assigned a value.\n* **Error Context:** The traceback provides information about where the error occurred.\n * It points to a cell within `` specifically line 35.\n * The line in question is `weather_url = f\'https://www.bbc.com/weather/{location_id}\'`.\n* **Code Snippet:** The code snippet suggests a program attempting to construct a URL for the BBC Weather website. The intention seems to be to retrieve weather data for a specific location.\n* **Comments:** The lines 33 and 36 are comments explaining the following code.\n* **Error Header:** “Error: Could not find location ID for Nur-Sultan” indicates that the program was trying to find the ID for Nur-Sultan and failed.\n\n**In essence:** The image illustrates a common programming error where a variable is used without being initialized. This likely occurred during an attempt to fetch weather data from the BBC website for the city of Nur-Sultan.image936×343 26 KB
In the second question are we supposed to edit the JSON manually until we reach a correct answer ? I think the expected result has some difference from what shows up in the website

How to actually do the HNRSS one…i can’t find much.
How did u do the links? I’m unable to do links
Just copy paste the expected value in place of actual value in json. Keep doing this eventually it would be the answer would be correct.
This is a format issue when the json is scrapped from the browser.
Request help on Q4 aboutBBC weather data, the instructions in the question tell us to use BBC broker API and get issueDate &amp; enhancedWeatherdescription value pairs. However, it seems there are only 2 unique values of issueDate (not the expected 14 days)

It\'s a dark-themed view showing the status and details of automated workflows.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **Title Bar:** The top section reads "All workflows," indicating a display of all workflow runs. A search bar labeled "Filter workflow runs" is present, allowing for filtering of the displayed runs.\n2. **Feedback Banner:** A prominent yellow banner asks the user to "Help us improve GitHub Actions" and provides a "Give feedback" button.\n3. **Workflow Run List:** The main content shows two workflow runs, both titled "Action runs everyday".\n * Each run is identified with a green checkmark, indicating successful completion.\n * The runs are triggered by "Scheduled" or "Manually run by Rajalakshimi52".\n * The branch is shown as "main".\n * The time of the runs is "2 hours ago". \n * A calendar and number indicating the run number are present for each workflow.\n * A vertical ellipsis (•••) icon suggests more options are available for each run.\n4. **Column Headers:** The table displays headers for "Event," "Status," "Branch," and "Actor," providing context for each workflow run.\n5. **Count:** The image indicates that there are "2 workflow runs" visible.\n\n**Overall, the image showcases a clean and organized view of successful workflow runs within GitHub Actions, highlighting their scheduling or manual triggering and branch.**image1345×424 23.7 KB
Manual correction will not work. Try to extract - from the console. I did it like that it was not working then I extracted from console then it worked
Please ensure that your .yml file should have step name as your email Id. then Manually trigger the task (don’t wait till the scheduled time), ensure it was committed within 5 minutes and that commit should be top most item in all workflows. Then check it, it will work
You can find some text blue in color and underline use some dumy url it will work
You can find some lines having second, third words are uniformly aligned. Those are tables

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a web-based learning or testing interface. The background is dark, likely a dark green or black, and text is displayed in a lighter color for contrast.\n\n**Content Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Heading:** The top line states "5. Enabling CORS: Configure the web application to include appropriate CORS headers, allowing GET requests from any origin." This suggests the lesson or test topic is about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).\n2. **Question:** "What is the URL of your API endpoint?" is displayed, indicating a prompt for user input.\n3. **Input Field & Answer:** An input field contains the text "http://127.0.0.1:8000". To the right of the field, a green checkmark indicates that the answer has been accepted as correct.\n4. **Confirmation Text:** Under the input field is the text "Correct".\n5. **Instructional Text:** The next line reads "We\'ll check by sending a request to this URL ?country=... passing different countries." This describes how the answer will be validated.\n6. **Button:** At the bottom left of the screen is a bright blue rectangular button labeled "Check".

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Screenshot of a Web Browser:** The image is a screenshot of a web browser window, likely Google Chrome, as evidenced by the browser controls.\n* **Browser Address Bar:** The address bar displays "127.0.0.1:8000/?country=india", indicating a local server is running and accessed with a query parameter indicating the country is set to India.\n* **Tab Titles:** Several tab titles are visible, including "Mathematics for Data Science", "BS-DS_Jan 2025 Group", "Untitled1.ipynb - Colab", and potentially more truncated titles.\n* **Output from a Code Execution:** The main content displayed is the number "44", which appears to be the output of a code execution, likely in a Jupyter Notebook environment (as evidenced by the "Untitled1.ipynb" tab).\n* **"Pretty-print" Indicator:** The text "Pretty-print" is visible, and possibly an empty square box, which suggests a formatting option or status related to the output.\n* **Dark Theme:** The overall interface is presented in a dark theme, with a black background and light-colored text and elements.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the image captures a development or data science environment where code is being executed on a local server, and the output "44" is being displayed in the browser.image766×237 12.2 KB
Sir I have solved  Q2, But a problem arises that, At the index 11, in the IMdb website it is listed “The Recruit” but it is showing Expected: “Graymail”.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a snippet of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, likely from a database or API response.\n* **Data Structure:** The data is structured as a list of objects, with each object representing a media title (likely a movie or TV show).\n* **Fields:** Each object contains the following fields:\n * `id`: A unique identifier for the title (e.g., "tt26584495").\n * `title`: The title of the media (e.g., "8. Companion").\n * `year`: The release year of the media (e.g., "2025").\n * `rating`: The rating of the media (e.g., "7.4").\n* **Media Titles:** The snippet includes data for several media titles, including "8. Companion", "9. The White Lotus", "10. High Potential", "11. Anora", and "12. The Recruit".\n* **Error Message:** At the bottom of the snippet, there\'s an error message: "Error: At [11].title. Values don\'t match. Expected: "12. Graymail". Actual: "12. The Recruit"". This indicates a data discrepancy where the expected title for item 11 is "12. Graymail", but the actual title is "12. The Recruit".problem621×159 42.4 KB
How to fix this?
you have to manually change for a few mismatch.



 s.anand:

@21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.


Yes …due to the location difference the search results are different for everyone therefore you need to adjust it accordingly
It might need around 6-7 amendments
The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated.
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values:
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you  need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.
While submitting solution, do I need to keep all the local servers running/local URLs like 127.0.0.0 stuff, else I am getting one question as correct &amp; the other one mentions unable to fetch data!? So that means I need to run them in different different ports?
I posted this error message but now the first issue got resolved but I am still keeping it in my post so that if anyone faces same issue, they can try if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me.
Please help with the second issue.

For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.
How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works.


Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.


I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a snippet of JSON data (JavaScript Object Notation).\n* **Data Structure:** The JSON data appears to be an array of objects. Each object represents a movie and contains key-value pairs.\n* **Movie Attributes:** The objects include attributes like "id", "title", "year", and "rating". \n* **Movie Examples:** \n * "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (year: 1966)\n * "Fight Club" (year: 1999, rating: 8.8)\n * "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"\n* **Error Message:** A red error message at the bottom of the image states "Error: At [0].id. Values don\'t match. Expected: "tt20221436". Actual: "tt0437179"". This indicates a mismatch between the expected ID ("tt20221436") and the actual ID ("tt0437179") for the first movie entry in the data.\n* **Background:** The background is dark, likely a terminal or code editor window.image706×257 17.3 KB

Neque tantum desidero porro est civitas caute laboriosam valetudo." Some words are underlined in red.\n* **Secondary Heading:** A secondary heading is present: "## Key Points".\n* **Bulleted List:** A bulleted list follows, containing two items:\n * "- Vomito antiquus consequuntur"\n * "- Amplius curis subiecto"\n* **Error Message:** A prominent red error message indicates that words like "back," "legislature," and "info" are missing or not properly separated as words.\n* **Concluding Text:** At the bottom is a sentence explaining the difficulties in correctly extracting Markdown from a PDF and suggesting that manual corrections are necessary. It mentions a focus on only checking a few basic elements.\n* **Overall:** The image illustrates a somewhat flawed Markdown conversion process from a PDF, highlighting the challenges in automatic text extraction and formatting.image1618×513 46.3 KB
Can anyone help me with the 10th question. Whatever I changed with the code , it is asking something. I checked that these words are not present in the pdf itself
I didn’t get any error for Astana.
The error may be due to incorrect loops in your code that’s why it’s going out of range, check for that.

It worked for me; only 4–5 values caused errors, which I fixed manually. Additionally, I corrected the console code, which now provides the correct result.
what is this magic trick… please elaborate …
Error: At [10].id: Values don't match. Expected: "tt16027074". Actual: "tt8008948"

i dont see that value in data …
You can manually edit that. I also have to manually edit one entry to get the correct answer.
Hi,
As mentioned in the question, you have to sort by “joined” so it should be “https://api.github.com/search/users?q=location:Seattle+followers:&gt;120&amp;sort=joined&amp;order=desc”
There are two “Vienna”. The question4 is referring to which one?
Manually make correction in your answer as provided in the error message. If no such words are available insert those and check
check if the action is commited
try copying the expected result and pasting it inside the quotations
Check the log of the daily commit .
Ahh, I have the same doubt too!
For the links, this format worked for me:
[ &lt; link text &gt; ] (#)
Yes I got it now. Thank you!
it should be “2.9” instead of 2.9
looks like formatting or the passed conditions have some issue… can you check and verify it once and see?
Error: At [3].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “4. 365 Days - Noch Ein Tag”. Actual: “4. The Next 365 Days”
{“id”: “tt21106646”, “title”: “4. The Next 365 Days”, “rating”: “2.9”, “year”: “2022”}
my result , there is no any entry with “4. 365 Days - Noch Ein Tag” on IMDB
I am getting missing links as error in the 10th question. How to do it?
Mine is giving 1/10 on running without even writing anything? This is happening for Q3? Is it just a glitch?
Yes happened to me too, refresh the page, mine got fixed!
Check you pdf you can find a word with blue colour and underline. Give some dummy link and use link mark with the word
Best way to solve Q2 is , look at the network tab in dev tools and get the url used for assessment and get data from it .
u have used a apace (_) after 2.9  which is not visible at front that’s why it is throwing error , it should be just (“2.9”) not ("2.9 ")
Agreed and I have tweaked my approach to get the correct answer. But I feel the question instructions should be adjusted accordingly - the question says to get every issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription key value pair - but only 2 such pairs exist ; whereas in the final answer it is forecast date &amp; weather description total 14  pairs.

Open the BBC Weather website.
Press Ctrl + Shift + I.
Select the ‘Network’ menu.
Select ‘Fetch/XHR’.
Type ‘Karachi’ in the input field on the website. Do not press Enter while entering the location; just type the location. Pressing Enter might cause ‘location?api_key=…’ to disappear.
‘location?api_key=…’ will appear in the inspect menu.
Double-click it to open a web page (https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key={api_key}). This will give the API.
Alternatively, single-clicking ‘location?api_key=…’ will open headers where you can see the Request URL and the API key.

Hi, Can anyone help me with Question 10?
No matter how i try to post the markdown, it is always showing that either the words are missing or are different from the original. I have tried every possible way i could think of but it is not working.

Hi Team,
I have made the JSON from the IMDB website using JS, But do i miss any filter conditions,
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of what appears to be a code editor or terminal window displaying JSON data and error messages. The background is dark, typical of such environments.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n* **JSON Data:** A snippet of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data is visible. It includes fields like "year": "2024", "rating": "6.0", and "id": "1230292390". The data is formatted with key-value pairs.\n* **Error Message:** Prominently displayed in red text is an error message: "Error: JSON value doesn\'t match. Expected: \'11. Sebastian Fitzek: Der Heimweg\'. Actual: \'11. The Calendar Killer\'". This indicates a discrepancy between expected and actual data values during a parsing or data extraction process.\n* **Informational Message:** At the bottom of the screenshot, a gray text message informs the user that IMDb search results may differ by region, requiring manual translation of titles and periodic rerunning of scraper code.\n\n**Context & Likely Purpose:** The image strongly suggests a data scraping or web automation task involving IMDb (Internet Movie Database). The code likely extracts information from IMDb pages, and the error message indicates a problem with the data being scraped—specifically, a mismatch in the expected title. The final line points to the need for regular maintenance of the scraping script due to changes on the IMDb website or regional variations.image1640×302 20.4 KB

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image shows a screenshot of a text editor or code editor window. The background is dark, and the text is displayed in a monospaced font, common for code or plain text. \n\n**Content Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Heading:** The top line reads "What is the markdown content of the PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?" \n2. **Code Block:** A multi-line block of text is enclosed within what appears to be a markdown code block. It contains words or phrases separated by vertical bars ("|"), such as "adficio|chirographum", "vitae|ipsam", "spectaculum|claudeo", and "comes|celeber".\n3. **Text Line:** Below the code block is a single line of text "Decumbo decumbo suadeo totidem apto."\n4. **Checkmark:** To the right of the code block is a green checkmark.\n5. **"Correct" Label:** Below the text line is the word "Correct".\n6. **Descriptive Text:** Below the "Correct" label, a block of text reads: "It is very hard to get the correct Markdown output from a PDF. Any method you use will likely require manual corrections. To make it easy, this question only checks a few basic things."\n\n**In summary,** the image seems to depict a test or exercise related to extracting and formatting text from a PDF file as Markdown. The screenshot shows a successful outcome (indicated by the checkmark and "Correct" label) where the text extraction has been completed and likely validated against basic requirements.image657×516 26.1 KB
In the 10th question, how do we add headings and links to the markdown output?(getting error: Headings missing)
first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors
yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system.
but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole  redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.
this is a changing dataset so make changes to your answer accordingly and you will get it correct
Do the necessary changes as it is said below as it is an everchanging dataset.
You will get the answer correct once you make the changes asked after checking.
check you code and do the changes like max_latitude
replace [0] to [1]

Respected Sir,
How can I Solve this, I’m not able to solve this one
Hi,
For the 4th question, We can get the necessary information issueDate and its description from Summary itself right? or am I seeing the stuff in the wrong place?
Change it manually.
add the expected answer
when you press ctrl+c it turns off the server and same goes for refresh.
also you dont need to manually write ?country… just write till outline and turn on the server n you are good to go.
ok this is fine for now and its showing correct also but at the time of evaluation will my server runs??
It is written in the ques to get the link in the link tag. Not the post link.  Like this

Thank you bro, I will try this
not at all. your last saved marks will be considered
just replace value instead of it. same problem I also that time I check code and modify serval time I faced same error. so just ignore it and replace expected value instead of actual value in our Json.
extract the pdf to markdown format using chatgpt then add links,tables and one blockquote
Try to use the key ‘enhancedWeatherDescription’ parsing through the summary object (or) use the BeautifulSoup to find ‘div’ with attributes of

my answer is in above format i tried changing to “2024-”, "2024- " to number tried after reloading the page but still i am getting
Error: At [11].year: Values don’t match. Expected: “2024”. Actual: "2024– "
You have to manually change these thing
from actual change to expected.
For me, error was almost 10 times.
on your 11th or 12th instance change it
write the actual value
If you have submitted on the assignment site and saved it in time, then that score is the actual score and will be updated directly on the student dashboard.
Your answer is correct. Just add a space after the hyphen—it will resolve the problem. Or you can copy and paste from here: '2025– '.

i wrote everything that was there in the pdf file after converting to markdown, there is no code inside the pdf file then how does it expect to have code in markdown, can anyone help
Yeah! His issue is genuine. Arnav’s JSON seems to be correct, yet these are some issues faced by him.
Yeah! even I am facing this issue. Despite lot of efforts, last question markdown seems to always incorrect. It is always throwing any sort of error for no reason.
The IMDB and weather questions was a pain along with the 10th question, wasted so much time @s.anand , the questions were nowhere tough, it was the problems with the evaluation part i had spend hours just to  sit and correct the JSON file and no comments on the 10th question’s part.
I am fine with the academia being challenging to study not the evalation making me manually edit solutions
@Jivraj @carlton
yes change manually, there are slight changes which we have to do

i 'm here for the bonus marks,
But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this.
We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course.
And i have never seen any course cool as this,

like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom  , gave client side answer checks’s code to o1 and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this)
keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI.
( i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem )

why everytime question 2 answer is showing error in json?
What error are you getting @Abhay222 ?
Can you post a screenshot or error details ?
Is it safe to skip Q4 for those who got the city named Nur-Sultan, since it has been renamed to Astana, and the answer for Astana is incorrect in the portal?
@s.anand
There is possibly wrong evaluation in q6 as it is taking in 2nd latest link as the correct answer. I might be wrong, but the latest one is giving me incorrect evaluation while the 2nd latest is giving me the correct score.
getting the same issue Error: At [12].year: Values don’t match. Expected: "2024– ". Actual: “2024”
yes this kind errors.
@Abhay222 @22f3002184
if you look closely the expected value is 2024-  and actual that you are supplying is 2024.
Difference ? your value does have a - and a space at the end.
reason ? you might be scraping it ? trim() or maybe using innerText to get tag’s text ?
it seems we are intended to provide country specific versions for Individual students simulating being an analyst for MNC in various locations. Clearly you got Spain and I seem to have gotten France, although it doesn’t seem to be mentioned in the question itself.
Thank you Tanya for pointing out this issue.
Just tell me this, has your city changed? If yes then what was it earlier and what is it now.
any reply regarding this please

the movie may have  different title on IMDb (perhaps in another language) according to region which is why there isnt an exact match u can manually format it to get marks

Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)”

Check if you have made the query proprly. also, check if you taken the correct link from the item
in q10 i am getting error- missing links.
can i get any explanation about this error so that i can figure out this ?
@Saransh_Saini  as i left with this question only
Pdf content one link, I think your converting method was unable to convert link into markdown format , add it manual from pdf.
I have done that also but still getting same error
The one with blue line must be link here in the pdf.
After that it asking to add tables, i added the same but the issue ‘Missing Tables’ exists



 23f2000573:

if it says something is missing, just add the same. refer to week-2 question 1 for markdown syntax if necessary


refer to this @21f3000745



 22f3000804:

can someone help through this error!!


if it is saying something has a mismatch, just spot the mismatch one by one and manually change it @22f3000804
Here for the bonus marks, it was great solving the GA4.
After you click the link, a page containing all the questions will appear. Attempt them and save it on that particular page using your IITM email ID. Through your ID, submissions will be taken.
Thankyou , but now i am getting missing code error. What it means? @23f2000573
You just have to add a space after a hyphen
Check if you are using table formating where there is a table, also there is perhaps a code block in the pdf where a small section of text is in different font than the rest.
No there is no code block in the pdf. Now i m getting missing code error. Why this error can arise @Saransh_Saini
I am also facing the same error in this question
the answer format is correct the link is probably not the latest one, I had the same issue because my code was working only for the first 100 entries… you should try paginating your code so it can cover more entries
just change the values as itis coming in the error
change the name manually as the name is diiferent on imdb according to the region, I had the same issue…
are you able do it now? Reload and check
yes facing the same thing
you are missing code block
Normal : print(123)
Code Block : print(123)
you can refer to week 2 q1  for the syntax of code block

I’m assuming it’s occurring because the text formatting for the JSON is incorrect. Try and put it in the correct format

Anyone who received the Nur-Sultan parameter for this question and at least attempted it will get a mark.
Kind regards
sir what about bonus marks cuz my score was 9/10 due to q4(Nur-sultan).
The bonus mark will be processed afterwards. That is checked before the scores are pushed to portal.
Nominatim API gives me the bounding box of the location. How exactly the bounding box helps me to find the details of the location?

Here are the Discourse IDs that replied to this post. @carlton could you please add 1 mark to them in the GA (not the overall score)?

Please include only those are enrolled this term, obviously.
If they didn’t attempt GA4, please include them anyway and give them 1/10.
If they got 10/10 already, please add 1 mark anyway and give them 11/10.

As you can see in this screen shot i already tried this question and getting error so i posted it on discourse. But still i did not get any marks for attempting this question.
i got only 9/10.
Hello @s.anand @carlton Sir,
As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4 I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add that bonus mark to the total kindly.
Hoping for a positive response.
Thanks &amp; Regards

I am not saying anything regarding bonus marks. I am asking GA4 q4  about
Nur-Sultan in this question everyone getting error after post in discourse ,sir say who attempt this question get a marks .But i am not recieved this question marks
if a student has 10/10 and his name is in the bonus list, how would that look like in the dashboard?
I don’t think it is added in my case.
It will show up as 110  marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon.
Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science


    It will show up as 110  marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon. 
Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5, is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline, but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.
is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I  understand that each set of students get different questions. @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand
