This image shows Saransh presenting a Python FastAPI application live during a video conference. The screen displays VS Code with two files open ("fast.py" and "data.csv"), featuring code comments explaining logic to read CSV data via `pd.read_csv` and handle API requests asynchronously using `@app.get("/api")`. A status bar indicates the app is running, while the meeting UI confirms Saransh is sharing their screen.
