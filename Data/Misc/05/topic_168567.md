Post:  If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right? 
Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split  the tasks efficiently and get it done. 
Thoughts?

 What's the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? (https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2) What's the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?   Tools in Data Science (/c/courses/tds-kb/34) Tools in Data Science 
 
 
 @ankit.jain (/u/ankit.jain) @ankit.jain  – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. 
What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. 

Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”
Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”

Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. 
Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…
