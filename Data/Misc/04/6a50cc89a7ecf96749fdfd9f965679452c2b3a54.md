Here's a detailed description of an API testing interface shown in the image:

The screenshot depicts a web page explaining data fetching via `/api` endpoint based on "class" query parameters (e.g., `/api?class=1A`). The URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` is highlighted, and an error message "TypeError: failed to fetch" appears below it. A blue 'Check' button allows users to send a request for validation against provided data.
