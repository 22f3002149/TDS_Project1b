The instructions also define the expected response to a GET request with parameters for names \'X\' and \'Y\', which should return a JSON response containing the marks for those names in the same order. \n    *   A code snippet showcasing the expected JSON format is included: `"marks": [10, 20]`.\n\n3.  **Instruction 3:**  Indication that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) should be enabled to allow GET requests from any origin.\n\n4.  **Instruction 4:**  A question prompts for the Vercel URL. The expected format for the URL is given as `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`.\n    *   An example Vercel URL is also provided: `https://vercel-tdc-one.vercel.app/api`.\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n\n*   The text is white against a dark background.\n*   Code snippets and URLs are visually highlighted using a light blue background.\n*   The interface style suggests a command-line environment or a dark-themed code editor.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the image presents a series of instructions for setting up a Python-based API endpoint on Vercel, emphasizing the expected input and output format.', thinking=None, images=None, tool_calls=None)
