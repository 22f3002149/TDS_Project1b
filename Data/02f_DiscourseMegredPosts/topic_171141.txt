# Topic: Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies

Please post any discrepancies related to project1.

Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?
All the image ids we evaluated were what you submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us.
For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

What is the highest mark anyone has scored? Is it 22/20
@Carlton?
How come me and my group used same code but some got 10 some 11 some 12?
@carlton Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.
We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.
You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.
I have noticed that my image was run on a x86_64 architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is ARM. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error.
This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.
My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389
We will check and rerun on arm if we ran it on the wrong emulation.
Any suggestions for my case sir ? I’m really tensed.

@carlton  same issue, My image was also run on a x86_64 architecture. I too built on my mac which is ARM (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error  and  Evaluation log file is MISSING.
Actually my image was run on x86_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.
I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:** The image is a screenshot of a Docker Hub repository listing, likely from a web interface. It displays information about a Docker image.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Repository Name:** The repository is named "kuroki".\n* **Image Tag:** The specific image tag is "latest".\n* **Last Pushed:** The image was last updated 1 day ago.\n* **Image Size:** The uncompressed layer size is 176.2 MB.\n* **Image ID:** The image ID is listed as "f1cacd8d5f1e".\n* **Copy Button:** The image has a "copy" button for the image pull command.\n* **Command:** The command is "docker pull onedragonhub/kuroki:latest".\n* **Description:** The image is maintained by "onedragonhub".\n* **Information:** The image is a Docker Hub repository.\n\n**Color Scheme:** The image features a dark theme with blue text, providing clear visibility.Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 12.51.59 AM1613×182 19.1 KB
Even just now I tried running the exact image:
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:** The image displays a command-line interface (CLI) output, likely from a Linux or Unix-like system.\n\n**Content Breakdown:**\n\n* **Command:** The initial line shows a `podman run` command, which is a containerization technology similar to Docker. This command is launching a container with specific parameters.\n * `-im`: Indicates interactive mode with terminal allocation.\n * `-e AIRPROXY_TOKEN`: Sets an environment variable named `AIRPROXY_TOKEN`.\n * `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 of the host machine to port 8000 of the container.\n * `047fa151bf43`: Specifies the container ID.\n* **Output Messages:** Subsequent lines show output messages indicating the status of the application being launched within the container.\n * "Started server process \\[1]"\n * "Waiting for application startup."\n * "Application startup complete."\n * "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)" - This confirms that the Uvicorn ASGI server is successfully running and listening on port 8000.\n* **Visuals:** The text is displayed in a terminal with a dark background and light-colored text (likely white or light green).\n\n**In summary:** The image shows a successful deployment of an application, likely a web application, using Podman and Uvicorn, which is now running and accessible on port 8000.Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 12.53.35 AM1220×169 25.8 KB

My evaluation log file is missing in report provided. It says tasksA was not found. but I have submitted tasksA in my project file. Also it says server didnt start for 5 mins but for me image was working fine. please kindly help me out. I have made submissions correctly. I request for re evaluation of my project. my roll no is 22f1000703
Respected,
I haven’t received any mail yet regarding the TDS Project 1 marks.
Please look into it.

My evaluation log file is missing.
The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.
the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,
What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?
This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07
My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.

@carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj
Sir I have noticed a technical glitch for the docker issue, wherein I mistakenly uploaded the wrong docker image link so kindly please kindly re evaluate it.
Sir I haven’t received any mail regarding this Project1 marks. @Jivraj @carlton
@carlton Sir , my Docker image is built on Macbook M1 which as you know uses ARM64 architecture . But evaluated with x86_64 which caused the exec format error due to cross platform compatibility issues . I am kindly requesting you to re-evaluate the project once again .
This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: d0f14a872042  , but i had never provided this docker image then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id.
Please, look over it.

I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures.

Bonus: Additional tasks. We may pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.
Regards,

Would you mind reviewing the evaluation.log screenshot I have attached? I believe I may deserve marks for Task B6. @carlton, could you kindly take a look?
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:**\n\n* The image is a screenshot of a console output or a debugging log, likely from a software testing or data processing process.\n* The output contains a combination of text logs, expected values, and results.\n\n**Key Components & Details:**\n\n1. **Successful HTTP Request:**\n * A green line indicates a successful HTTP request: "HTTP 200 Scraped data saved to ../data/b6.json"\n * It shows that data has been scraped and saved to a file named "b6.json".\n * The request was made to "http://localhost:8052/readpath/data/b6.json" and returned a 200 OK status.\n\n2. **Expected Data:**\n * A red line indicates the "EXPECTED" values: `[\'Albert Einstein\', \'J.K. Rowling\', \'Albert Einstein\', \'Jane Austen\', \'Marilyn Monroe\', \'Albert Einstein\', \'Andre Gide\', \'Thomas A. Edison\', \'Eleanor Roosevelt\', \'Steve Martin\']`\n * This appears to be a list of strings (names) that the process was anticipating.\n\n3. **Result Data:**\n * A JSON structure labeled "RESULT" is displayed.\n * Inside the JSON is a list under the key "author" containing the same string values as the "EXPECTED" list:\n * "Albert Einstein"\n * "J.K. Rowling"\n * "Albert Einstein"\n * "Jane Austen"\n * "Marilyn Monroe"\n * "Albert Einstein"\n * "Andre Gide"\n * "Thomas A. Edison"\n * "Eleanor Roosevelt"\n * "Steve Martin"\n\n4. **Failure Indication:**\n * A large red "X B6 FAILED" message at the bottom of the image indicates that a test or validation associated with "b6" has failed. Although the JSON result matches the expected data, the test still failed. This suggests there might be a separate failure condition or a check unrelated to the data values themselves.\n\n\n\n**In summary:** The image shows a successful data scraping operation, where the scraped data matches the expected values. However, a test or validation step related to this data ("b6") has ultimately failed.image1460×585 24.9 KB

can you please take a look at this screenshot?
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a terminal or console output, displaying the results of a task involving image processing and data extraction, likely a test or automated process.\n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n1. **Status Indicators:**\n * "A7 PASSED" indicates a successful completion of a test case or task labeled "A7".\n * "Running task" shows a description of the process being executed - processing a file named "data/card.jpg", extracting the card number using an LLM (Large Language Model), and writing the result to a file named "/data/cc-number.txt" without spaces.\n\n2. **HTTP Requests:**\n * A POST request is made to "http://localhost:8001/run" with a long, encoded task description as a parameter. The successful response is "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".\n * A GET request is made to "http://localhost:8001/read?path=/data/cc-number.txt" to retrieve the content of the output file. The response is also "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".\n\n3. **JSON Result:**\n * A JSON response is displayed, containing the `"result"` field which states "The task of extracting the card number from the image and writing it to `/data/cc-number.txt` has been completed successfully."\n\n4. **File Content Comparison:**\n * The content of `/data/cc-number.txt` is presented with "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" labels, both showing the extracted card number: `6011598665215965`. This confirms the task was completed successfully and the extracted number matches the expected value.\n\n**In summary:** The image documents the successful execution of a process that extracts a credit card number from an image using an LLM, and then writes and verifies the result in a text file.image1451×640 64.9 KB
The task was done but the LLM made a mistake. I think this type of mistake was outside our control. @carlton
@carlton @Jivraj
Please correct me if I’m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks B7, B8, and B10, the evaluation log does not include any POST or GET request traces, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a console output or log from a web scraping or data processing task. It appears to be a record of HTTP requests, code execution, and status updates. The background is black and the text is predominantly green, red, and white, typical for console output.\n\n**Key Elements & Observations:**\n\n1. **HTTP Requests:**\n * `HTTP Request: POST ...` A POST request to a URL (`http://localhost:8078/run?`) with a lengthy query string that includes parameters related to web scraping (e.g., `task`, `url`, `output`). The status is "200 OK," indicating success.\n * `HTTP Request: GET ...` A GET request to retrieve a file (`data/b6.json`) with a "200 OK" status.\n\n2. **JSON Data/Output:**\n * The JSON output indicates that the task involves scraping quotes from famous people from the first page, extracting the author\'s name.\n * The JSON array includes names like "Douglas Adams" and "J.K. Rowling."\n\n3. **Code Snippets:**\n * Python code is included within the output, indicating the script used for scraping, including import statements for `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, and logic for parsing HTML and extracting data.\n\n4. **Task Status & Errors:**\n * A section labeled "TASK" indicates a progression of tasks, some with "PASSED" status.\n * Two tasks are marked as "FAILED," with error messages:\n * "Failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting"\n * "Failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting"\n\n5. **File Operations:**\n * An image is downloaded from a URL (`https://dummyimage.com/100x100/000000/ffffff.png`) and saved to "data/b6.png," resized to 50x50.\n\n**In essence, the image provides a log of a web scraping process. It shows that the scraping was attempted, data was extracted, and the process encountered formatting errors that caused some tasks to fail.**image2003×745 95 KB

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a text-based evaluation report, likely from a coding competition or automated assessment system. The text details the performance of a Docker image and provides links to relevant log files for debugging. \n\n**Key Content Breakdown:**\n\n* **Header:** The message at the top indicates that if the Docker image didn\'t run, it was misconfigured and offers contact information. It also states a score of 0 indicates missing files.\n* **Performance Metrics:** It mentions the expectation of a response within 5 seconds and notes the system uses 8-core Xeon Google Compute units, indicating a powerful server. The server wasn’t a bottleneck, but network bandwidth (1 Gigabit) was considerably faster than typical domestic internet.\n* **Detailed File List:** The body of the text is a numbered list of files related to the evaluation process:\n 1. **Evaluation log file:** Contains performance reports of individual tasks.\n 2. **Docker log file:** A link to a Google Drive file (detailed URL provided)\n 3. **USP-dpmedik:** Provides technical performance data for the container.\n 4. **Server start log file:** (separate logs for arm vs x86) – Logs to help diagnose startup issues.\n 5. **Evaluation script file:** (separate logs for arm vs x86) – The actual tests run against the submission and the scoring mechanism.\n 6. **Data generation file:** Used to create the data for the tasks.\n 7. **Docker orchestration file:** Retrieves the Docker image from Docker Hub and launches the container.\n 8. **Solution script:** (zip file) – The full project and example of using prompt engineering concepts to achieve the desired result.\n* **Evaluation ID:** The last line indicates the ID of the evaluated Docker image is "e1f86d9ce91".\n* **Mobile Interface:** The image shows the native interface of a mobile device with options for zooming and screenshotting.\n\n**Overall, the image presents a technical report on the performance of a Docker image, with detailed file references for diagnostics and analysis.**\n\n\n\n10004720831080×2400 255 KB

Hi @all
We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86 platform.
We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time, before pushing to the dashboard.

It would have run at your end but it was supposed to run at anywhere, after dockerising it didn’t run, reason is taskA module was not found.
Same issue for me sir. When I evaluated my file using evaluate.py my 9 cases out of the 10 in Task A was passed but the email I received shows that my evaluation log file is missing. I don’t understand why does it show like that. Please do check and help me out sir.

I suspect there is something wrong with how the evaluation has been done. Although A1 task succeeded, all of my A tasks failed.
I have checked my log file in all of the cases where a file is required it says file not found or directory not found error in the code, how can I check /data folder was provided to the program?
@carlton
@Jivraj , @carlton
It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the os library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.”
I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a text-based log file displayed within a web browser, likely a debugging or processing log from a data analysis or machine learning task. It shows a series of HTTP requests, errors, and messages related to image and text processing.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n* **Browser Interface:** The screenshot shows portions of a web browser (likely Chrome) including the address bar, tabs (labeled "TD5", "Progi", etc.), and a status bar showing a temperature of 27°C and the time (09:38 AM).\n* **Log Text:** The majority of the image is filled with white text on a black background, presenting a sequence of log messages.\n* **HTTP Requests:** Several lines begin with "HTTP Request:", indicating attempts to access resources via HTTP. These requests often include URLs and status codes (e.g., "404 Not Found," "200 OK").\n* **Error Messages:** Red "FAILED" indicators highlight errors. Specifically, multiple errors indicate a failure to find files such as "data/mail-sender.txt" and "data/cc-number.txt".\n* **Processing Tasks:** Lines such as “Running tasks: ‘data/card.jpg’ has a credit card. Pass the image to an LLM, extract the card number, and write it without spaces to ‘data/cc-number.txt’” describe the operations being performed, which appear to involve extracting information from images and processing text data. There is also a task to find the most similar pair of comments.\n* **File Paths:** The log includes mentions of file paths like “data/card.jpg”, "data/mail-sender.txt", and “data/cc-number.txt”, indicating a directory structure used in the process.\n* **LLM and Embeddings**: Mentions of "LLM" (Large Language Model) and "embeddings" suggest the use of machine learning techniques.\n\n**In summary:** The image depicts a system attempting to process images and text, specifically extracting credit card numbers from images and analyzing comments, with various errors occurring during the process. The log provides detailed information about the HTTP requests and errors encountered.Screenshot (177)1920×1080 206 KB
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a screenshot of a code editor window, specifically a file named "app.py" open within a GitHub interface. The code appears to be Python, likely related to a web application or API.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **GitHub Interface:** The top bar shows the standard GitHub elements like file navigation ("Files"), commit history ("Blame"), and repository information. The URL in the address bar confirms the file\'s location on GitHub.\n* **Code Editor:** The main section of the image is dedicated to the code editor, displaying lines of Python code. Syntax highlighting is used, with keywords, strings, and comments visually differentiated.\n* **"app.py" File:** The code displayed is within the "app.py" file, which is part of a project named "LLM-based-Automation-Agent."\n* **Code Snippet:** The visible portion of the code includes function definitions (e.g., `def start(self):`, `def read_file(path: str):`), conditional statements (`if not path:`), and exception handling (`raise HTTPException`). The code appears to handle file reading, API requests, and potentially interactions with an LLM (Large Language Model).\n* **Sidebar:** A sidebar on the right shows a list of symbols (functions, constants, etc.) defined within the file.

Same here. I also dis not recieve any mail sir.
I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.
Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong
@23f2001975 we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.
If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.
We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.
Kind regards
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a Python traceback, indicating an error that occurred during program execution. \n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n* **Traceback Header:** The traceback begins with "Traceback (most recent call last):", standard for Python error messages.\n* **File and Line Number:** The first error line points to a file named "app/app.py" on line 30. The code on this line is: `AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ[\'AIPROXY_TOKEN\']`.\n* **Error Origin:** The traceback indicates the error originated within a call to `os.environ` while attempting to access the environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`.\n* **Error Type:** The error is a `KeyError: \'AIPROXY_TOKEN\'`. This indicates that the environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` was not found or was not set before being accessed by the program.\n* **File Reference:** The traceback further points to "", line 716, indicating the error is related to the underlying operating system interaction.\n\n**In summary:** The image shows a Python program that failed because it could not find the environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN`. This suggests a missing or improperly set configuration value.image633×197 4.25 KB
This is a screenshot of my docker log file. This works if you pass the actual value of the airproxy token at the command line while pulling the docker image. Please do look into this as I’ve put a lot of effort into this.
Thank you

@cartlon Same issue.
My image was also run on a x86_64 architecture. I too built on my mac which is ARM (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error and Evaluation log file is MISSING.
Can you please rerun the image on ARM based
You have a misspelling in your environment variable, thats why it failed. We do pass the token to your docker exactly as specified in Project 1 page.

You have to identify the exact bug for your claim to be considered. Thats why we have provided you with the scripts and the logs. You might get lots of marks. Its in your interest to identify the bug.
Kind regards
@carlton @Jivraj what do I do sir am seriously clueless and heartbroken rn pls help atleast for A tasks we should get it
We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.
Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.
If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.
Kind regards
@carlton
I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:
{
"detail": "'choices'"
}

This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY_TOKEN. Could you please look into this?
Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a command-line interface (likely a terminal or console) displaying a series of text-based outputs and error messages related to running a script and formatting a file. It appears to be a debugging or execution log. \n\n**Detailed Breakdown (Point-by-Point):**\n\n1. **"Running task: Install \'uv\' (if required) and run the script..."**: This line indicates the initial task was to install a package named \'uv\' if it wasn\'t already present, followed by the execution of a Python script whose URL is provided.\n2. **HTTP Request (POST):** There is a POST request being made to a local server at `http://localhost:8180/run`. The request includes a large string of parameters related to the script execution. \n3. **HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error):** The server responds with an HTTP 500 error code, indicating an issue on the server-side while processing the request. The detail associated with the error is "choices".\n4. **HTTP Request (GET):** A GET request is made to `http://localhost:8180/read?path=/data/format.md`, which attempts to retrieve the content of the file `data/format.md`.\n5. **"HTTP 404 Not Found":** The server responds with a 404 error, meaning the requested file `data/format.md` could not be found.\n6. **"AI failed: Cannot read /data/format.md":** An error message stating that the AI system failed to read the specified file.\n7. **"X AI FAILED"**: A red "X" with the text "AI FAILED" emphasizing the failure.\n8. **"Running task: Format /data/format.md" with prettier 4.2.0**: The next attempted task is to format the file `/data/format.md` using a tool called "prettier" version 4.2.0.\n9. **HTTP Request (POST):** Another POST request to `http://localhost:8180/run` is made with different parameters, this time for formatting the file.\n10. **HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error):** Again, a 500 Internal Server Error occurs.\n11. **HTTP Request (GET):** A GET request is made to `http://localhost:8180/read?path=/data/format.md` as before.\n12. **"HTTP 404 Not Found":** The file is still not found, resulting in another 404 error.\n13. **"AI failed: Cannot read /data/format.md":** Error message is repeated.\n14. **"X AI FAILED"**: Error indicator is repeated.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe image depicts a series of failed attempts to run a script, format a file (`data/format.md`), and retrieve the file\'s content from a local server. The file is repeatedly not found (404 error), and server-side errors (500 errors) prevent the script from completing successfully. The AI system also fails to read the file due to it not being found.Screenshot 2025-03-29 1033271511×749 29 KB
We have given you the evaluation scripts. Identify where exactly you believe the bug is.
Just guesses is not going to get you extra marks. You have to give us something specific.
Kind regards
@Jivraj sir please kindly look into it. Please re-evaluate my image, everything was working fine it is an issue with the docker image. Please re-evaluate it sir and please guide me as what to do
I encountered the same issue with evaluate.py. However, since you previously advised against coding strictly with evaluate.py, I didn’t pursue it further. Now, I’m concerned—how is this a mistake?
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a text-based output, likely from a software testing or logging process. It displays a comparison between "EXPECTED" text and "RESULT" text, with a "FAILED" indicator.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n1. **File Path:** The top line indicates the file being processed: `/data/logs-latest.txt`.\n2. **"EXPECTED" Text Block:** A large block of text representing the anticipated output. The text appears to be a series of phrases or sentence fragments, possibly related to financial or economic data analysis, like "Investment direction themselves suddenly", "Pressure property piece threat interesting", and "Matter statement last trial television".\n3. **"RESULT" Text Block:** Another large block of text, visually identical to the "EXPECTED" block. This section represents the actual output produced by the software or process being tested.\n4. **Comparison & Failure Indication:** A red "X" labeled "FAILED" appears, indicating that the "RESULT" text does not match the "EXPECTED" text. This signifies a test failure.\n5. **Text Format:** The text within both blocks is displayed in a monospaced font, commonly used for logs and code.\n\n**In Summary:** The image documents a failed test case, where the actual output ("RESULT") does not align with the expected output ("EXPECTED"). The content of the text seems to revolve around financial or economic phrases.Screenshot (56)1492×362 22.9 KB
Please provide more time for this. Right now, we are also busy with the second project. There are other courses as well.
yaa same issue i am also facing ,
and this LLM thing is very new for us , and we tried our best to complete. , but because of local machine issue , or anything , people end up getting 0 marks , or 4-5 marks , ..
As a lot of students are getting 0 , so please give some bonus , or some marking for there efforts ,
TDS dont have quiz , ,and getting 0 in project will decrease our CGPA too .
please think for it sir @carlton

So, did my docker ID change when I submitted?
I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project, so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really don’t know where I have went wrong.
Jivraj Sir had checked liked this for another student, so I just wanted to confirm the same for me.

Hi @carlton !
I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!
Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.
@carlton,
Jivraj said, “We will discuss internally if we can do something about it.” I understand this well. The output from my server is slightly different, but it still achieves over 95% accuracy. Please do consider it.
Hi @Pritul_raut
No, we won’t reevaluating it.
Hi @22f2001389
  File "/app/app.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    from tasksA import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'

The error occurs because Python cannot find the tasksA module. This is due to the file not existing, not being in the correct directory.
Kind regards

It displays the output of Docker commands.\n\n**Specific Details:**\n\n1. **Command Execution:** The terminal shows the execution of two Docker commands:\n * `docker pull --platform arm64 rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3` - This command pulls (downloads) a Docker image named `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds` with the tag `v3` specifically for the `arm64` architecture.\n * `docker images | grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"` - This command lists all Docker images on the system and then filters the output to show only the image named `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds`.\n\n2. **Output of `docker pull`:** The `docker pull` command outputs:\n * `Digest: sha256:bd2d0e879ec6b9a4a2b156602a7c6abd118c4d10f6ca39e9dd78b0c6cab7542` - This shows the SHA256 hash (a unique identifier) of the downloaded image layer.\n * `Status: Downloaded newer image for rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3` - This indicates that the image was successfully downloaded.\n\n3. **Output of `docker images`:** The filtered output of the `docker images` command displays information about the downloaded image:\n * `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds` - The name of the image.\n * `v3` - The tag of the image.\n * `466630e32b8` - A short image ID.\n * `5 weeks ago` - The time since the image was created.\n * `581MB` - The size of the image.\n\n4. **Prompt/Username:** The prompt at the beginning of each line appears to be `usr/22f3002542_ds_study_iitm_ac@tds-course-temp-bo:~$` indicating the user, host, and current directory.\n\n**In essence, the image shows a user pulling and verifying a Docker image named `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds` with the tag `v3` on an ARM64 architecture system.**image1757×250 24.9 KB

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image shows a screenshot of the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor interface. It\'s a code development environment, displaying a file explorer panel and editor window.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n* **File Explorer Panel:** The left side of the image features a file explorer listing project files. Some notable files include:\n * `app.py` (highlighted in blue, indicating it\'s the currently open/active file)\n * `datagen.py`\n * `docker-compose.deb`\n * `docker-compose.yml`\n * `Dockerfile`\n * `evaluate.py`\n * `requirements.txt`\n * `tasksA.py`\n * `.env`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, and `pyvenv.cfg` (configuration and version control files).\n* **Editor Window:** The right side of the image displays the content of `app.py`. Lines of code are visible, but the content is not legible. Numbers from 17-22 are visible in the right margin, likely line numbers.\n* **Status Bar & Notifications:** At the top of the window, a message reads "Python extension loading...". \n* **Search Bar:** There is a search bar at the bottom, labeled "Type here to search."\n* **User Interface:** Standard VS Code icons are visible in the activity bar (e.g., for search, source control, debug).\n* **File Paths:** A file path (C:\\\\Users\\\\...) is also visible in the right window.\n\n**Context:** This screenshot suggests a Python project that is being developed using VS Code, likely involving Docker for containerization, as indicated by the `docker-compose` and `Dockerfile` files. The project seems to be focused on data processing or machine learning, given the presence of files like `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`.image2160×3840 1.92 MB

Yeah, it’s there on your local machine, but you didn’t copy it to docker container.
Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error.

@carlton good afternoon sir,
I completed my project 1 and submitted it as instructed. But the result show that evaluate file missing. I did everything right but don’t know how this as the result come. I also had evaluation file in my project too. Please go through things again as this is very unfair for those who took 2 weeks to do this project. My roll no. is 22f3001664. I hope I will get marks, of not full then should be 10/20.
Thank you sir
What to do now sir ? Is there no way to fix this now ? I can change the docker file and overwrite the docker image if you allow me to do so.

Figure out the problem in our script and do a pull request to it, we will fix it if it’s a valid bug.



 Jivraj:

Create Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 .


We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we mentioned in live sessions.
Line number 81 of your app.py
subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)
which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.
@Jivraj @carlton
I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.
I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.
These are the detailed point wise concerns :


I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.


By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.


I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.


I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.


I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.
Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.
I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.
Thanks and Regards
I haven’t received any mails regarding the tds project 1 please look into my concern
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand
Sir please consider a re-evaluation for me, please :’)
Please consider my situation a peer whos results were exactly same as mine has received 9, then how could I get 1 . 23f1002630 this is my role number please reconsider
@carlton @Jivraj
Few Students including me have not received any mails regarding TDS Project 1. We don’t even know what went wrong or why we didn’t received. Initially I thought that it can be due to some sending error and i will receive little late but even after 14hrs we have not received anything from the team. How are we supposed to check log and see our mistakes when we didn’t even received marks and logs. I request to check into it and provide us our marks and logs.
Thank You.
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand
I had built the project well on my Mac OS machine. I am very disappointed with the scores. How do i make amends for revaluation as I feel the code ran well for all tasks on my machine. Please give written steps for revaluation.
Its saying that my evaluation log file is missing, i submitted everything properly. It also says no module named TasksA is found while i got 9/10 marks in the tasksA evaluation script. Kindly look into this, i worked really harrd for this project, @carlton @Jivraj
@22f3000935 Page Not Found | Docker Hub
you submitted this docker url through form response for project1, this repo doesn’t exists on docker.
@Jivraj sir please tell me whats the issue am very confused and worried
We are aware about such mistakes and we are looking into it. We will reevaluate those images.
If evaluation file is missing for anyone, we will reevaluate it once more and send same through email.
Can you fill form for architecture detection.

mine is linux/amd64 sir it doesnt come under arm or x86 i think
Hi @23f2002400
Check your Dockerfile if it copies tasksA.py file to docker container.
If it does where does it copy, these are possible mistakes. You were expected to test docker images.
Hi @23f2000599

Ok sir, will fill the form, thank you
One issue file is my app is listening on port 8000. But evaluations being done on 8219 port. so how it will succeed. Please guide what to do.
That’s external port mapping, we mapped your docker’s port 8000 to external 8219 port, so it won’t create issues.
Just look at docker_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it was for evaluating multiple images parallely.
There is a mistake in the url I guess check this out I have a fully functional image which was pushed 1 month ago
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a screenshot of a Docker Hub or similar container registry interface, specifically the image management section for a repository named "pscodes24/dataworks-agent". The interface is dark-themed.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Repository Information:**\n * Repository name: "pscodes24/dataworks-agent"\n * Last pushed: approximately 1 month ago\n * Repository size: 490.1 MB\n* **Tabs:** A navigation bar with tabs for "General", "Tags", "Image Management" (currently selected), "Collaborators", "Webhooks", and "Settings".\n* **Search Bar:** A search bar for filtering images by tag or digest.\n* **Image List:** A table listing the images within the repository. Columns include:\n * **Digest:** The unique identifier for each image layer.\n * **Tags:** Tags associated with each image (e.g., "latest").\n * **Media Type:** Indicates the image is of type "Image".\n * **OS/ARCH:** Operating system and architecture ("linux/amd64").\n * **Size:** The size of each image layer (e.g., 273.5 MB, 262.3 MB).\n * **Last Pushed:** Timestamp indicating when the layer was last pushed.\n * **Last Pulled**: Timestamp indicating when the layer was last pulled.\n* **Docker Command Snippet:** A section on the right provides example Docker commands for pushing new tags to the repository.\n* **Pagination:** Pagination controls (1-2 of 2) at the bottom suggesting there might be more images than displayed.\n\n**Visual Details:**\n\n* The interface uses a dark background with light-colored text and table elements.\n* Checkboxes are present beside each image digest, presumably for selecting layers.\n* "BETA" is labeled on the "Image Management" tab.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the image provides a snapshot of the image management interface within a container registry, allowing a user to view and manage the layers that make up their container image.image1103×611 55.7 KB

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a text-based output from what appears to be a test or validation process, likely related to a Markdown file. It shows an "EXPECTED" output alongside a "RESULT" and indicates a test failure.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n1. **File Path:** The top line displays "/data/format.md" indicating the file being tested is a Markdown file named "format.md" located in the "data" directory.\n2. **EXPECTED Output:** This section presents the expected content. It includes:\n * A header line: "# Header"\n * A table-like structure with columns "Start," "Mid," and "End," represented by dashes and numbers (1, 2, 3).\n * A paragraph line: "Paragraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace."\n3. **Python Code Snippet:** A short Python code block:\n * `print("23f3001745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in")`\n4. **RESULT:** This section shows the actual output received during the test. It\'s a string that appears to be a direct representation of the "EXPECTED" output with newline characters (`\\n`) and carriage returns (`\\r`).\n5. **Failure Indication:** A red "X" with the text "A2 FAILED" indicates that the test failed. It suggests that the "RESULT" did not exactly match the "EXPECTED" output.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe test is verifying the correct formatting of a Markdown file, specifically:\n\n* Presence and formatting of a header.\n* The structure of a table.\n* The presence and specific content of a paragraph (including checking for extra spaces or trailing whitespace).\n* The output of a Python print statement.\n\nThe test failed because the "RESULT" and "EXPECTED" outputs did not match, likely due to discrepancies in whitespace or newline characters.image1340×431 9.45 KB
This is the correct answer, eval script is not considering newlines properly. @Jivraj @carlton
same with me  i dont understand how i got 0.
This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 2a8ffa96b140 , but i had never provided this docker image instead my image id is 735a5a477fb2 then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id. My docker image was created on linux/amd64.

Sir, my evaluation log file is missing, even though I followed all the steps to generate the Docker image correctly. The system indicates that the server didn’t start within 5 minutes, but when I uploaded it, everything was working fine. I put in a lot of effort into this project, and I’m worried I might receive a zero despite making the submission correctly. Kindly help me resolve this issue. My roll number is 22F3004068.
Additionally, my Docker image ID was d2f27c03b878, but the ID mentioned in the email was dfac8596cd4c. Please provide clarity on this discrepancy.
I have also attached my Docker log file for reference

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.
I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image shows a screenshot of a text-based error message, specifically a Python traceback. This indicates that a program encountered an error during execution and is providing information about the sequence of function calls that led to the error. \n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n* **Traceback Header:** The top line reads "Traceback (most recent call last):", which is standard for Python traceback messages.\n* **File Paths:** The majority of the image consists of lines specifying file paths and line numbers within those files. These indicate the sequence of function calls that were made. For example: "File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/click/core.py", line 1161, in \\_call".\n* **Function Names:** Within each file path line, you can see function names like "\\_call", "invoke", "run", and "serve".\n* **Module & Code Snippets:** The bottom part of the image shows the beginning of the problematic code within a module, starting with the line: "File "module/imptool.py", line 12, in ".\n* **Error Message:** The last few lines contain the actual error message, starting with: “sqlite3.dbapi2.OperationalError: no such table: features".\n* **Text Color & Background:** The text is white against a dark background, which is common for terminal or console output.\n\n**In summary:** The image captures a Python traceback that indicates a database error ("no such table: features") occurred within a program that uses the `sqlite3` database library. The traceback provides a detailed call stack to help diagnose the source of the problem.Screenshot (423)1486×895 43.2 KB
Sir so the  user_email isn’t passed while pulling the docker image?

Hello,
My log file shows a “file not found” or “directory not found” error. Could you confirm whether datagen.py was executed inside the Docker container or on the host OS? If it ran on the host, I don’t see any mounting process for the /data folder into the container. Could you please clarify this?
@carlton @Jivraj
is it like this: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ‘system_input.txt’ ?
I am getting this error.
@Jivraj @carlton sir, I have fixed my docker image issue that was causing the error. Please re-pull my docker image so that I can get score. Please consider me for re-evaluation. All the codes were correct, only issue was a glitch in the docker image.
Hello Sir, I am facing the same issue. Please look into it. Before submission, I ran my Docker file with the evaluation script to ensure it was working, and it worked fine. Kindly help me out. My roll number is 23F3004321.
Yes, something like that, My log file shows when script tries to access file it says file not found or directory not found.
Sir, I checked my evaluation log, and the error occurred because the AI proxy token limit was exceeded. I ran the evaluation script to verify, and I scored 12/20.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a command-line interface (CLI) window, likely a terminal or console. It displays text-based output from a Python application utilizing the Flask web framework. The output appears to be a traceback (error message) indicating an issue within the application.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1. **Debug Mode:** The top lines indicate the application is running in debug mode, providing detailed error messages and warnings.\n2. **Address/Port Information:** It specifies the application is running on all addresses (0.0.0.0) and port 8000.\n3. **Traceback:** The majority of the image consists of a traceback. A traceback is a report of the sequence of function calls that led to an error. It includes:\n * **File Paths:** The traceback details the files and line numbers where the error occurred, specifically referencing files within the Flask application structure (e.g., `/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py`).\n * **Function Calls:** It shows the sequence of function calls that were active when the error occurred (e.g., `wsgi_app`, `handle_exception`, `full_dispatch_request`).\n * **Exception Type:** The traceback reveals that an `UnboundLocalError` occurred. This means that the application tried to use a variable before it was assigned a value.\n * **Variable Name:** The specific variable name causing the error is "ut".\n4. **Application Setup** It also shows the code line where the error occurred: `file "/app/run.py", line 12, in `\n5. **Context:** The application is related to a task named "Say-HelloWithCarlton" and is running with HTTP/1.1\n6. **Date and Time:** The output indicates the time the traceback occurred: 2024-03-28 05:58:25.\n\n**In essence, the image captures a moment when a Python Flask application encountered an error, specifically an `UnboundLocalError`, and provides the traceback details for debugging.**image1456×765 41.6 KB
Here\'s a detailed point-by-point description of the image:\n\n* **Visual Overview:** The image depicts a black screen with white and red text, indicating a log or error output from a software application or system. It appears to be a debugging or status report.\n* **Error Message:** The primary message states, "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv". This strongly indicates an issue where the application cannot access or read the specified CSV file.\n* **HTTP Request & Response:** Two HTTP requests are displayed:\n * A `GET` request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/b10.csv` returned a "404 NOT FOUND" error, confirming the file is inaccessible.\n * A `POST` request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` returned a "200 OK" status.\n* **Status Indicator:** A status is reported as "Score: 12 / 20", possibly indicating progress or a success rate in a larger process.\n* **Failure Indicator:** A large red "X" and the text "B10 FAILED" clearly highlight the failure associated with the identified file.\n* **Error (JSON):** There\'s a JSON snippet at the top: `{"error": "unable to open database file"}`. This is also indicative of an issue accessing a database or data source.\n\n**In summary,** the image shows an error condition where an application failed to read a CSV file (`b10.csv`) from a specific path, possibly due to the file not being found or an inability to access it, accompanied by a database file opening error. The application seems to be running on a local server (`localhost:8000`) and has successfully completed a separate POST request to a different endpoint.image1094×256 9.59 KB

My docker logs shows that OSError: Cannot find resource error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a terminal or command-line interface displaying an error message related to Python code execution. It shows a traceback indicating a failure in opening a font resource while processing an image (presumably a credit card image).\n\n**Detailed Points:**\n\n* **Text-Based Output:** The entire image is filled with text. The text is white on a dark background, typical of command-line interfaces.\n* **Traceback:** The primary content is a traceback, a standard error report in Python. It lists the sequence of function calls that led to the error.\n* **File Paths:** Several file paths are visible, indicating the locations of Python modules (e.g., `/root/.cache/uv/environments-v2/ffad5b5c0487eb6/lib/python3.13/site-packages/PIL/ImageFont.py`).\n* **Error Message:** The central error message is “OSError: cannot open resource”. This suggests a problem accessing a font file.\n* **Font File References:** The traceback mentions font files such as "arial.ttf" and "DejaVuSans.ttf," indicating that the code was attempting to use these fonts.\n* **Code Snippets:** There are fragments of Python code, like `large_font = ImageFont.truetype(...)`, showing the code that triggered the error.\n* **Exception Handling:** There\'s an indication of exception handling ("During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:"), suggesting a cascade of errors.\n* **Module References:** References to modules like `PIL` (Pillow, the image processing library) and `ImageFont` are visible.\n* **"Installed 3 packages in 42ms"**: This message appears at the very top, indicating that packages were recently installed.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe image depicts a Python error, likely occurring during an image processing operation involving font loading. The error message points to an inability to open a specified font file.image1485×807 37.4 KB
The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?

I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail.
So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .
Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.
Thank you
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a terminal or command-line interface, showing text-based output. It appears to be the result of running a Python script with some configuration, and encountering errors.\n\n**Key Elements & Breakdown:**\n\n1. **"Running task:" Message:** The first line indicates that a task is being executed. It mentions installing `uv` (a Python package manager) if needed, and then running a script located at a GitHub URL: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/f19b6797f82b6da39ac4f3a7d4392a/raw/13246698088795e1942179856aafd46052b66ae/datagen.py` with a specific argument `23f3003196@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.\n\n2. **"HTTP Request:" Message:** This line demonstrates an HTTP POST request being sent to `http://localhost:8503/run?task=install+uv&ifrequired=29&run+the+script+%360http%3a%2f%2fgist.githubusercontent.com%2fsanand0%2ff19b6797f82b6da39ac4f3a7d4392a%2fraw%2f13246698088795e1942179856aafd46052b66ae%2fdatagen.py%3f60%230winth%3a60%2f23f3003196%40ds.study.iitm.ac.in%3f60%2f+as+the+only+argument%3f60` It appears that the script (`datagen.py`) is being invoked via a local web server.\n\n3. **"HTTP 500 Internal Server Error"**: This line confirms that the HTTP request resulted in a "500 Internal Server Error". This suggests that something went wrong on the server-side while processing the request.\n\n4. **"HTTP 500" Error Detail**: The bottom of the image details the 500 error, indicating an error message: "429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions" indicating the script is likely making requests to OpenAI and has hit a rate limit.\n\n**In Summary:** The image depicts an attempt to run a Python script via a local web server, which results in an internal server error and details a rate limiting error from OpenAI.image1505×276 16.1 KB
this is a 429 from sanand which is an error from your side. The evaluation already so delayed now has such issues because of which I am getting 1/20. @carlton @Jivraj
does that mean our script is not evaluated?
Hi @Vihaanv07
This was a good spot, we will rerun all the images where string Agent Errro: 429 Client Error.... is present.

The background is black, typical of a terminal, with text displayed in various shades of green and white. \n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n* **Header:** At the very top, there\'s a line indicating the last login time and the hostname (`mish@Mishs-MacBook-Air`).\n* **Column Headers:** The output is formatted into columns with the following headers:\n * `REPOSITORY`\n * `TAG`\n * `IMAGE ID`\n * `CREATED`\n * `SIZE`\n* **Docker Image List:** A list of Docker images is displayed, each row representing an image and including details such as:\n * `REPOSITORY`: The name of the Docker image repository (e.g., `dc-project`, `mish/automation-agent`)\n * `TAG`: The tag associated with the image (mostly "latest")\n * `IMAGE ID`: The unique identifier for the image.\n * `CREATED`: The time since the image was created (e.g., "5 weeks ago," "2 months ago").\n * `SIZE`: The size of the image in MB or GB.\n\n**Specific Images Listed:**\n\nThe following are a few of the listed images:\n\n* `dc-project:latest` (1.75GB)\n* `mish/automation-agent:latest` (367MB)\n* `franzy/tesseract:latest` (2.28GB)\n* `mish/myrepo:latest` (12.2MB)\n* `vitali/tesseract:latest` (29.5MB)\n* `franzy/ngrok:latest` (244MB)\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a system administrator or developer\'s terminal session showing the current inventory of Docker images on a MacBook Air.Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 7.53.20 PM1440×900 13.2 KB
My docker image id is different than the one I submitted
“This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 10f11a0e0cd6”
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand plz check this
Hi @23F300327
This is what you submitted to us in the gform.
23f3003027@ds.study.iitm.ac.in	mishkat02/automation-agent:latest
We will only evaluate this image.
Kind regards
@carlton then why is the image id different?
in the docker hub as well as my local terminal the image id is 07b16dc68225
When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form.
In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.
But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear.
We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question.
Kind regards

Greetings, Sir,
I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.
To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.
I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.
Thank you for your assistance!
Hi @carlton, I checked my Docker log file now and realised I missed to push a couple of files to the image. Is there anything I could do now? I have all the required files in my Git repo though. Please help.
Sir in my logs it is showing that there’s cv2 module missing i mightve missed adding that in the requirements. Is there anything you could do to help me please?
I am also facing the same issue. I tried evaluating the scripts with the evaluation file also. Please rerun and let me know. My Roll No is 21F1002866.
Hi,
For Tasks A8, A9 &amp; A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.
For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK
ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK


Similarly for task B2.

For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.
For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?
Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8
@Jivraj @carlton
Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build
ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.&lt;xxx&gt;.com:80
 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.&lt;xxx&gt;.com:80

ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
 ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}

This was required  as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..
So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container  started up without issues..
Checkin url: Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub
Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well..  didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation… Appreciate your help
I am also with the same situation sir. Please help with this issue. I have submitted everything correctly and it was working fine. Thanks
Hello Sir,
Greetings,
I have not recieved amy mail regarding my Project 1 Marks, can you please look into it.
Thank you/
@Jivraj @carlton please sir could you help me with this issue previously when i ran on my system it was working perfectly fine
Hello sir
I noticed that the log mentioned:
“python: can’t open file ‘/app/app/main.py’: [Errno 2] No such file or directory.”
However, my main file was named run.py, which might have caused the issue. Since the code was present, I was given a 0. Would it be possible to run it again or consider partial marks for the submission?
Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate your help!
Even my file saying the same. I got the ‘No module named tasksA’ error whereas at the time of submission it was working perfectly fine. Please kindly look into this issues sir.
Thank you.
no taskA.py even though i ran the evalution getting 12 score still no evalution.log
help the students please give them second chance
on a side note, to validate and test our docker/podman images on a platform outside of our dev environment we can use https://labs.play-with-docker.com/.. this is a free platform to download run and test docker images …
Hi @carlton @Jivraj
I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe_open function that will throw a HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?
Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this

Your dockerfile is misspelt.
Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.
However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.
Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir.
The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.
But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.
Kind regards
I recently received an email stating that my Docker image is not publicly available, resulting in a failed prerequisite check for the TDS Project 1. However, I have ensured that my Docker image is publicly accessible. Please help.

My Docker image ID is "99d08f2002fa ", and it is set to public. I kindly request you to review this issue, as I have worked very hard on this project and would appreciate the opportunity for a fair evaluation.

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a mobile web page, likely a documentation or instruction set for a data analysis task. The page contains a series of text-based instructions regarding the process of counting rows from an SQL query and saving the results to a CSV file. There’s also error messaging displayed at the bottom of the screen.\n\n**Content Breakdown:**\n\n* **Top Section (Instructions):** A lengthy paragraph outlines steps for running an SQL query using `curl`. It details fetching data, specifying the endpoint (`http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales`), and saving it to a CSV file named `data/b10.csv`. The instructions mention using commands in a terminal to stop the server and clean up background jobs.\n* **Command Examples:** Embedded within the text are specific command-line examples for executing the `curl` request and managing the server process.\n* **Error Message:** A prominent red error message is displayed: “B10 FAILED: Cannot read \'/data/b10.csv’”. This indicates that the script was unable to find or access the specified output file.\n* **Score & Request Details:** Below the error message, there’s a "Score: 10/17" displayed, suggesting the script partially completed. Details of HTTP requests are also presented, showing a `GET` request failure with a 404 error (Not Found) for the same file (`/data/b10.csv`). A subsequent `POST` request to `https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings` is also indicated.\n* **Page Header:** The header "23f2005702@ds.stud…” suggests this is a page related to a dataset study.\n\n**Overall, the image shows a failed attempt to run a data analysis script, highlighting a file access error.**Screenshot_2025-04-01-08-51-03-781_com.google.android.apps.docs1080×2340 253 KB
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a mobile device displaying a text-heavy log or error message, likely from a data science or programming environment. It appears to be a debugging output, showing various HTTP requests and error responses.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1. **Timestamp & Filename:** At the very top, there\'s a timestamp "8:51 AM" and a file name in the address bar "23f205702@ds.stud..." suggesting this is a log file being viewed on a mobile device.\n2. **HTTP Requests & Responses:** The majority of the screen is filled with lines detailing HTTP requests (POST & GET) to `localhost:8462`. These requests attempt to run or read a dataset named "b10.csv".\n3. **Error Messages:** Multiple error messages are visible:\n * "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error" appears with a "detail" field containing an empty "choices" list.\n * "b10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" indicating the server cannot find the data file.\n * "HTTP 404 Not Found" when trying to read the data file.\n * "HTTP 429 Too Many Requests" suggesting a rate limit has been hit when accessing the OpenAI API.\n4. **Score:** A "Score: 1/20" appears, hinting at a performance metric or progress update.\n5. **Running Task:** A message "Running task: Install \'uv\' (if required) and..." appears, indicating the system is trying to install a package.\n6. **File Path:** The screenshot also shows part of a URL: "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/..." This looks like a link to a Gist repository, likely containing code related to the displayed process.\n\n**In summary:** The image shows an attempt to run a data science task (likely involving "b10.csv") on a local server, but it\'s failing due to file access problems, server errors, and potentially API rate limits. The user is also attempting to install necessary dependencies.Screenshot_2025-04-01-08-51-01-349_com.google.android.apps.docs1080×2340 219 KB

Respected Team,
I received an email stating I failed to fulfil prerequisite and scored 0 because of it.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a text-based evaluation of project prerequisites, likely from an automated system. The evaluation assesses whether certain criteria are met for a project submission.\n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n* **Header Text:** The top line warns that submissions failing to meet the minimum requirements will not be evaluated.\n* **Evaluation Points:** A list of four prerequisites are assessed:\n * Docker image presence and public accessibility: **FAIL**\n * GitHub repository presence and public accessibility: **PASS**\n * Dockerfile presence at the root of the GitHub repository: **PASS**\n * MIT license presence at the root of the GitHub repository: **PASS**\n* **Summary:** Below the list of evaluations, a final line states "Prerequisites: FAIL" and "Project 1 Score: 0". This indicates that, despite passing three checks, the overall prerequisite assessment failed due to the missing or inaccessible Docker image.\n\n**Overall:** The image is a straightforward record of an automated check, indicating that a project has failed due to a missing or inaccessible Docker image, despite meeting other prerequisites.Screenshot 2025-04-01 132313651×276 6.99 KB
I checked my Docker Hub and there it is showing “Public”
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Type:** The image is a screenshot of a data table or a dashboard interface.\n* **Layout:** It displays tabular data with column headers.\n* **Column Headers:** The visible column headers are: "Name," "Last Paid," "Combine," "Visibility," and "Sort."\n* **Data Row:** A single row of data is visible, with the "Name" field showing "cookieless72hr."\n* **Data in Row:** \n * "Last Paid" is indicated as "about 1 month ago."\n * "Combine" has a toggle-like state set to on. \n * "Visibility" is set to "Public."\n * "Sort" is shown as "Inactive."\n* **Color Scheme:** The background is dark (likely black or very dark gray), with white text for the headers and data. The toggle/switch is a lighter shade of gray/blue.\n* **Purpose:** It appears to be a configuration or management panel for a system or application, showing details of a setting or user named "cookieless72hr."Screenshot 2025-04-01 1319441479×124 7.78 KB

It offers information about the image\'s size, operating system, architecture, and last pulled date.image1525×741 52.8 KB
Sir, I have the image in the docker and it is upload last month and it is public. So why have I received a message saying that the image is not available in the hub. Can you confirm and reevaluate the error.
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand
Hi @Jayeshbansal ,
The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different than what your screenshot shows. /jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3 docker repo doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a code or text editor interface, likely within a software development environment. It displays tabular data with several columns. The background is dark.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Header Row:** The top row contains column headers:\n * "Timestamp"\n * "Email Address"\n * "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has code for Project 1?"\n * "What is the name of the image published on Dockertub?"\n\n2. **Data Row:** A single row of data is visible:\n * **Timestamp:** "2022-2/16/2023:23:53:44"\n * **Email Address:** "2411001095@ststudy.itm.ac.in"\n * **GitHub Link:** "https://github.com/jayesh-bamal/ITDS-project1(t)"\n * **Dockertub Image Name:** "jayeshbamal/itds:65568b"\n\n3. **Editor Interface:** The image shows a file named "2411001095@ststudy.itm.ac.in" with 369 lines and 12KB in size. The editor includes options for Preview, Code, Blame, and History. It also features buttons for refresh, split-view, and fullscreen.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the image presents a record containing a timestamp, email address, a GitHub repository link, and the name of an image published on Dockertub, likely as part of a project submission or documentation.image1826×222 23 KB
The log file provided to me too contains File not found error for task A. However, running the code on the evaluate.py files gave me results. Could you please look into the datagen part?
@carlton @Jivraj
Thanks
It is the request to the team,to consider this since it is a problem of just a case letter otherwise the whole hardwork of doing the project will be wasted.
Thank you
Dear instructors, I received the mail today regarding project 1 TDS scores and I have been marked fail because the MIT license is not present. But as can be seen in the screenshot below the MIT license file is present in my GitHub repository. Pls look into this matter.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository, specifically the file structure and commit history for a project named "Project1-TDS."

It depends where you tested it running, if it’s running inside a docker container and you feel there is problem with our script then you can debug our code and create a pull request on repo.
Hi @24ds2000125
You didn’t meet the standard naming convention for mit license naming.  Name should be LICENSE(all caps) or LICENSE.md.
check this out.

Hi @22f3001851
Standard naming convention for Dockerfile name was not followed we won’t be able to evaluate it.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image shows a list of checks or tests related to a software project, likely a coding project designed to be containerized using Docker and hosted on GitHub.\n* **Checks:** The checks evaluate whether certain criteria are met:\n * "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public": Fails.\n * "Is Github repo present AND public": Passes.\n * "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo": Passes.\n * "Is MIT license present at root of github repo": Passes.\n* **Status Summary:** \n * "Prerequisites" are marked as "FAIL". \n * "Project 1 Score" is 0.\n* **Visuals:** The text is presented on a light green background. The failed check is circled in red. There\'s also a question mark and three periods ( "?..") next to the third PASS. \n* **Inference:** This likely represents the results of automated testing or quality assurance for a coding project, where certain prerequisites (Docker image on Docker Hub) are not met, resulting in a failing score.\n\n\n\nimage412×167 4.49 KB

Here is a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Layout**: The image displays a table or list with three columns: "Last Pushed," "Contains," and "Visibility."\n* **Data**: The table contains two rows of data.\n * The first row shows "about 2 hours ago" in the "Last Pushed" column, "IMAGE" in the "Contains" column, and "Public" in the "Visibility" column.\n * The second row shows "2 months ago" in the "Last Pushed" column, "IMAGE" in the "Contains" column, and "Public" in the "Visibility" column.\n* **Visual Style**: The text is white on a dark (likely black) background. \n* **Highlighting**: "Public" is circled in red.

@Jivraj  Could you please check what’s wrong?
@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini any updates for the people like me whose image was run on the wrong architecture - mine was ARM ( was evaluated or ×86 ). I filled the form that was later sent for selecting the architecture.
I haven’t received any mail since then. But found many mails are sent to others in while.

@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton
The task B6 was
https://quotes.toscrape.com/ has quotes from famous people.
The .author class has the quote author’s name.
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.
E.g. ["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]
The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.
Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.
These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.
Kind regards
Hi Course Team,
I have also received an email today saying that my Project1 failed. But few days back I received an email with evaluation log saying I got 8/20. Which one is true?
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of an email regarding the evaluation of "Project 1" in a program, likely related to data science or software engineering ("TDS" in the subject line).

Can someone from TA team reply to this?
can somebody tell me how the dockerfile not running in 5 mins is my fault? i had the same requirements.txt as many other people and their file ran in given time while mine did not. what was the need for this, sorry for my harsh words but i’m frustrated, stupid rule?
For your case there was problem with our script that, we have correct, and your submission have dockerfile, license and repo exisits as well, it will be evaluated.

@carlton @Jivraj My P1 submission successfully passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th. However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues.
This situation is particularly disheartening—seeing days of effort and dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already demanding pace of the course.
I will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
Kind regards
I understand the problem. It may be possible that the image id i gave may be different as i had multiple dockerfile and there is a possibility that i gave the wrong image id due to some confusion. Is it possible for reevaluation. I have worked very hard and I don’t want to lose my marks because of some wrong id misconfusion. I request to check my dockerfile once again and provide the marks accordingly
dear @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
Dear Sirs,
I have seen that many others have posted similar issues to mine, and you have responded to some of them. To seek your attention, I am replying to this thread.
Please consider my request as well, as I do not want to lose marks on a project I have worked hard on, while also helping others. I am expecting a timely and positive response from your end.
Thank you.
Dear Sir,
I hope you’re doing well. I haven’t received any email regarding the results of Project 1. Could you please check if my result was sent or if there’s any update on this?

Name of your dockerfile doesn’t match the standard’s.
It should be Dockerfile(with D caps).
No we are doing another run of evaluations. Results will be sent soon.
dockerfile name should be Dockerfile as this is the standard they are considering .so it was not evaluated you better change that, if they revaluate it will be passed
Your submission have Dockerfile, LICENSE and repo exists as well, we found some problems because of redirects not handled in our script.
Your submission will be evaluated.
We won’t be considering changes after deadline, our script looks for commits before deadline and fetches latest commits before deadline.
That’s not possible, anything after deadline is not appreciated.
We have updated just files names will it be considered??

Standard name of dockerfile is Dockerfile that’s why it didn’t pass Dockerfile check
@Jivraj @carlton
I understand sir Dockerfile name was misspelt sir. Since my Docker image was built and recognized, I didn’t realize this would prevent evaluation.
I worked hard on this project sir, and my Docker image was built successfully. Please consider my submission sir.
I  have been trying to resolve all the errors but just noticed that my docker image id associated with the project is “c9dc7fbcf405” , meanwhile the mail I received mentions that some other image id was evaluated.
Can you please look into this matter and evaluate the correct Image ID.

@carlton @Jivraj
@Jivraj @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.
However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.

But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:*

Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning &amp; orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models.
Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.
Enhancing Shell-use &amp; Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.
Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.
Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.

All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents, and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent.

Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.
To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29, after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.
My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0—since it was already evaluated and graded.
Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj

Actually I got the email as my docker file is not in root git hub repository. But everything thing looks fine and my docker file also runs well.. I want to check my repo again ..sir kindly do my my evaluation again and we have put lot of efforts doing this project 1 . Hope the team evaluated and gives the deserved marks
@carlton
@ TDS TEAM
There is no Dockerfile in the root directory of your GitHub repository. The standard naming convention for a Dockerfile is Dockerfile.
@carlton @Jivraj please let know if any issues in my end on the docker image not present issue.. As explained in earlier thread , the only reason docker image had to be pushed  was the removal my office proxies in the docker image which was making the container not to startup from orchestration environment.. any help is appreciated..
@Jivraj @carlton  I updated google form 4 days ago on the architecture, Could you let me know when it will be re-evaluated ? Thanks
Hi @thinkmachine @22f3002723
Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.
We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.
This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases
Thanks for the understanding @Jivraj
Hi @thinkmachine
As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that.
@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini request your help in clarification for the same, the Github repo has been always present but it is marking it as fail. Thank you
A sigh of relief! Thank you so much for the heads up @Jivraj.
@Saransh_Saini Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future.
Once again, thank you both!
@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini
I am still uncertain as to why I received a second email regarding my project 1 score, indicating a failure due to unmet pre-requisites. I have inquired multiple times, yet I have not received a response. Meanwhile, several other posts, both before and after mine, have been addressed. Kindly clarify about that mail.
Thankyou
@carlton   Sir pls see my issue
I have the same issue. I also received a second mail stating I had failed due to some missing prerequisites though in the first mail my project evaluation had been carried out.
Hi @lakshaygarg654
Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.
We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.
We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.
Kind regards
@carlton @Jivraj
Sir can you also see the case of Dockerfile name. Many students have named it dockerfile , lower case ‘d’ character instead of upper case.
Please sir see through it
Thanks @carlton , for your response.
I was never worried about the result, whether it comes late or early. I know you will release it once everything is processed correctly. My concern was only about getting a response. Anyway, thanks for replying.
Also, today’s session has been canceled. I wanted to ask about the issue with editing responses in the Project 2 form. Is there any update on this?
Hi just wanted to know, there was no mail prior stating to keep the Dockerfile in the root folder of the repo (correct me if im wrong). Therefore i have put everything inside a folder - wont this be considered? Please clarify if possible.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository page, likely for a software project. The interface is dark-themed.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Repository Name:** "tds\\_project1", labeled as "Public."\n* **Branch:** Currently on the "main" branch, with 1 branch and 0 tags.\n* **File List:** A list of files within the repository is displayed:\n * ".github/workflows/main.yml"\n * "tds-project-1" (folder)\n * "LICENSE"\n * "README.md"\n* **Commit History:** Recent commit information is visible, including:\n * Author: "21f1002409"\n * Commit Message: "done"\n * Commit Hash: "4d2f5e5" - 2 months ago\n * Commit Count: 14 Commits\n* **File Details:** For each file, the last commit date is displayed (e.g., "2 months ago").\n* **Toolbar:** Buttons for "Add file" and "Code" are present.\n* **Bottom Navigation:** "README" and "MIT license" tabs are visible.\n\n**Overall:** The screenshot shows a basic view of a GitHub repository, outlining the files, recent activity, and branch information.Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 11.41.14 PM1884×750 69.2 KB
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image depicts a view of a project directory structure within a version control system, likely Git, as displayed in a web interface (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

Can anyone explain what errors of this sort mean?
You have to show which task triggered this error. Is it all of them or only one of them. Only then we can diagnose what the problem is.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a command-line interface (CLI) displaying error messages related to a task execution. It appears to be a debugging output from a software application.\n\n**Specific Elements & Messages:**\n\n1. **Task Initiation:** The first line indicates a task is running: "Running task: Format `/data/format.md` with `prettier@3.4.2` in-place."\n\n2. **HTTP POST Request:**\n * It shows an HTTP POST request to `http://localhost:8365/run?` with parameters related to the formatting task.\n * The request returns an "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error."\n\n3. **Error Details (JSON format):**\n * The `details` field reports "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts: Error code: 401."\n * The error message within the `error` field says, "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer."\n * It specifies the error type as "invalid\\_request\\_error".\n\n4. **HTTP GET Request:** An attempt to read the file `/data/format.md` through an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8365/read?` resulted in an "HTTP 400 Bad Request".\n\n5. **A2 Failed Message:** The message “A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md” appears after the failed GET request.\n\n6. **Visual Indicators:** \n * A red circle with a white dot indicates the task is running.\n * A red "X" symbol signifies that the task has failed.\n\n**Context & Interpretation:** The application tried to format a Markdown file (`/data/format.md`) using `prettier`, but it encountered issues. First, the task failed due to an authentication problem with the LLM (Large Language Model) service, receiving a 401 error. Later, attempting to read the same file failed with a 400 error, which likely stems from the initial authentication failure or file access permissions.10000041901193×1149 136 KB
Here it is with the task, however the error doesn’t seem to be related to the task itself based on the returned message in the JSON. It seems to be something wrong with the OpenAI API key. From the reading I did, it seems that the key was perhaps not set properly during evaluation? Not completely sure but please look into it.
Did all tasks produce the same error?
Yes except B1 somehow.
Hi @AryanTikam
I looked at your github repo, You have used python’s openai module for doing project1, but AIPROXY_TOKEN is supposed to be used through anand sir’s proxy.
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
Can you pls tell me my project 1 marks
My evaluation.py had 2 score
First one 1/20 where every task showed error second one had 10/20…
Dockerfile has to be insider root directory of github repo.
This was mistake from our end we rectified it and reevaluated your submission.
Your submission has a good score.
swati-iitm/project1_final
This is your github repo which doesn’t have a Dockerfile. That’s why It didn’t pass Prechecks
We have reevaluated it, we have scores avaliable for your submission.
Sir I understand you will be busy evaluating all the files and reevaluating them as well. I just wanted to know if its a confirm 0 for those who got evaluation log file MISSING and didnt get the other mail that many got in the past 2 days… Just to confirm… cause i think am getting 0 from that @carlton @Jivraj
So can anything be done about it now as it seems to pass more tasks without the proxy requirement? It is fine if not.
Please, can you put a screenshot of where it has been communicated, prior to the deadline.
We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.
We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.
In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand
So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.
Kind regards,
TDS team
@carlton Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.
I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.
Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.
Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of an email titled "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores". The email appears to be an automated notification regarding the prerequisites for a project submission, possibly a data science project (given the "TDS" likely stands for Towards Data Science).\n\n**Content Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Sender/Recipient:** The email is from "2211 se2002" to "me" (presumably the user).\n2. **Introduction:** The email starts with a greeting and states that the project requires passing specific prerequisite checks as detailed on the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page."\n3. **Prerequisite List:** A numbered list outlines the requirements:\n * GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.\n * GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.\n * GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.\n * Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via a specific `podman` command.\n * Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository.\n4. **Evaluation Warning:** A statement indicates that submission will not be evaluated if the minimum requirements aren\'t met.\n5. **Evaluation Results:** The email lists the results of the prerequisite evaluations:\n * "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"\n * "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"\n * "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"\n * "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"\n6. **Overall Status:** The overall status is "Prerequisites: FAIL."\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\nThe email indicates that the user\'s submission failed the prerequisite checks because of issues with the GitHub repository (not public, missing Dockerfile, missing MIT license). The Docker image itself was successfully published, but the GitHub repository setup was incomplete.Screenshot 2025-04-01 0206181335×667 57.9 KB

Same for me sir, i had everything correct still its showing:- Is Docker image present in dockerhub
AND is public: FAIL
I have submitted everything correctly . Please carefully look into this and recheck the project submitted.
Sir,it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image is a screenshot of an email regarding the evaluation of "Project 1" for a course called "TDS Jan 25". The email details pre-requisites for the project and indicates that the submission has failed to meet those requirements.\n\n**Specific Details:**\n\n* **Sender:** The email is from "se2002@study.itm.ac.in" (presumably a course instructor or assistant).\n* **Subject:** "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores".\n* **Content Breakdown:**\n * **Introduction:** The email begins with a greeting to "Learner" and states that Project 1 requires meeting specific pre-requisites. A link to "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page" is mentioned.\n * **Pre-requisites List:** There\'s a numbered list of five pre-requisites related to a GitHub repository, Docker image, and MIT license. The fifth prerequisite includes a command line example using "podman run".\n * **Evaluation Results:** The email presents a series of "Is..." statements evaluating the fulfillment of each pre-requisite, all of which result in "FAIL". These statements specifically check for Docker image presence, GitHub repository access, and the existence of the `Dockerfile` and license file at the root of the repository.\n * **Summary:** The evaluation concludes with "Prerequisites: FAIL" and "Project 1 Score: 0".\n * **Closing:** The email ends with "Kind regards, TDS Team".\n\n**Visual Elements:**\n\n* The screenshot shows the standard layout of an email inbox with sender, subject, date/time, and the email body.\n* The email body uses a plain text format.\n* The layout suggests the use of an email client like Gmail or Outlook.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the image conveys that a student\'s Project 1 submission has failed due to unmet pre-requisites regarding code repository setup and Docker configuration.Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 12.50.38 PM2062×1314 262 KB
@carlton sir, i would like to ask why marks showing 0 infact i am submitting all my requirements things in that form so plz look into this matter.
@carlton sir, similar thing happened to me as well, I had got the mail that git repo, dockerfile and lisence is not present or accessible while all the prerequisites are completed from my end. Can you please reevaluate my submission.

The results indicate the project failed because of missing or incorrectly configured components in the GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n10000515561238×2131 182 KB
Hi Prashant,
Your prerequisites have passed and your evaluation is 6 tasks have been completed successfully. The email was auto sent because we were doing some checks with an older, stricter script. The newer script passes your evaluation.
Kind regards
Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others.
if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall:** The image is a screenshot of an email notification. \n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Subject Line:** "[TDS Jan 2025] Important: Please check your submissions for basic sanity"\n* **Sender:** The email is from "donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in" to "se2002-announce."\n* **Date/Time:** The email was sent on February 16, 8:18 PM.\n* **Content:** The email body is addressed to "Dear Learners" and discusses a basic sanity check of their submissions for a course.\n* **Checklist:** It presents a checklist of criteria for the submission:\n * Is the GitHub repo public?\n * Does it have an MIT license?\n * Does it have a Dockerfile?\n * Is the Docker image accessible?\n* **Submission Status:** The email states that out of 530+ submissions, only 284 passed the basic sanity check. Emails were sent to 250+ learners about errors.\n* **Risk of Scoring:** It warns that Project 1 submissions are at risk of scoring 0 marks.\n* **Closing:** The email ends with "Regards, TDS team."\n\n**Overall Impression:** The email is a notification to students about potential issues with their project submissions and instructs them to check for basic configuration errors. It carries a sense of urgency due to the risk of receiving a zero score.Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 12.28.22 PM2236×912 208 KB
I agree with you. It should have been explicitly mentioned in the project page (even if we have mentioned it in live sessions)

Thank you
@Jivraj I too had the same issue (image was run on wrong architecture) and filled the gform that was circulated. When should we expect to get our scores?
Thanks
Pradeep Mondal
Hi @21f2000709
We have used another approach because of architecture problem, by pulling through latest commit from github before 18th feb. Just checked we have results for you.
Hi @23f1001415
This was a problem from our side and we rechecked and now we score against your submission.
Hi @23f1001524
This was a problem from our end, we have recitified it your submission was valid.
Your latest score through pulling from github and building image thorugh dockerfile have higher score than these 2.
Hi @23f2004563
I checked we have scores against your submission.
There was some problem with our script, later we correct and your submission was valid, I have just checked and confirm you.
Can u pls share marks :') dying with curiosity

Your submission was valid there was some issues with our script for checking. But after building your image after pulling github repo, it didn’t one taskA module was missing.
If you used openai’s python module then you were needed to pass your own api key, hardcode it in code.
API key that we were sending was only valid through proxy server created by professor anand.
mail will be sent by either today or tomorrow.
any idea on this sir?..
No we pulled through github and build image on gcloud vm. Anyone with valid submission didn’t receive mail, your submission was valid.
but my evaluation log file was missing… so that would make it a 0 right..I have accepted my fate that it would be a 0 but just a lil hope 
We reevaluated and found your submission was valid but it was running on a different port, 5000 but it was expected to run on 8000 port.
oh so… is it going to be considered? like will i get some score other than a 0… am sorry for asking so much
No it won’t be considered. It was supposed to be running on 8000 port.
Ok got it. Thank you so much

Hi sir, my Architecture says amd64, in the google docs I have selected x86, i hope it is correct. Also,  I have used podman to test the pull and its working well. Please let me know if i need to do anything else.
@carlton
We are rebuilding all docker submissions from github commit before 18th of Feb, using your Dockerfile manifest present in the repo.
That way there is no architecture issues.
Its part of our secondary check. And more students have gotten scores in this  check. So dont worry.
I just checked from my side also, wow a very dumb mistake now costing me a 0…should have read the project document more clearly  So sorry for asking.
Am assuming no lenient correction can be done for that? like during the evaluation …

I checked it multiple times before submitting, I got 9/10 in task A.
No. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.
Ok… I do have a doubt tho, i actually have app.py and main.py in my github, my main.py is running on 8000 and app.py on 5000 …
but in Dockerfile in your github repo you didn’t run main.py,
In your Dockerfile you didn’t copy taskA.py to the container.
Ouch, ok sir… hopefully project 2 doesnt disappoint 
It is there in the master branch of the repository. Now, will the previous evaluation mail that we got be considered or this one?
@carlton @Jivraj
I recently received an email with an evaluation file for Project 1, which included a score. However, in the recent email, I noticed that my score was recorded as zero, despite fulfilling all the prerequisites.
I kindly request a re-evaluation of my project, as I believe this may be an error.
@Jivraj
My discrepancy is still not fixed. Please take a look at it
@Jivraj
Hlo, could you please check and let me know how much am I scoring in Project 1 after the latest evaluation?
@Jivraj @carlton
Sir,
In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students.

It showcases the project\'s file structure and some basic information.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n* **GitHub Interface:** The interface displays standard GitHub elements like the repository name ("tds-project1"), navigation tabs (Code, Issues, Pull Requests, etc.), and buttons for adding files.\n* **Repository Structure:** On the left side, a file directory is visible, listing the project\'s files and folders:\n * `.github/` folder\n * `.gitignore` file\n * `Dockerfile` file\n * `LICENSE` file\n * `app.py` file\n * `requirements.txt` file\n * `tasksA.py` file\n * `tasksB.py` file\n * `README` file\n* **File History:** Next to each file, details on the last commit are given, like "initial commit" with the date "2 months ago".\n* **Repository Information (Right Panel):**\n * **"About" section**: indicates "No description, website, or topics provided".\n * **License:** Displays "MIT License".\n * **Activity:** Shows "0 stars", "1 watching", and "0 forks".\n * **Releases:** "No releases published".\n * **Packages**: "No packages published".\n * **Languages**: Displays a breakdown of programming languages with "Python 98.0%" and "Dockerfile 2.0%".\n* **Call to Action:** A prominent section encourages adding a "README" file with a green "Add a README" button.\n* **Top bar**: Includes search box, user profile icon and notification icon.\n\n**Color Scheme:** The overall color scheme is a light grayish blue, consistent with the standard GitHub interface. Green is used for the button and to highlight the file language usage.\n\n\n\nIn essence, the image shows an empty GitHub repository, recently created, with the basic files structure and a prompt to add a README file for better documentation.Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 10.44.24 AM3324×1794 497 KB
I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?
After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.
This is a common mistake many, many students made. They created a working application but not a working container.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image displays a code editor interface, specifically a Dockerfile within a GitHub repository.

The tabs visible include "Code", "Issues", "Pull requests", "Actions", "Projects", "Security", and "Insights".\n2. **File Structure:** The left sidebar shows a file structure for a project:\n * `.pycache_`\n * `.gitignore`\n * `Dockerfile` (currently open and highlighted)\n * `LICENSE`\n * `app.py`\n * `requirements.txt`\n * `tasksA.py`\n * `tasksB.py`\n3. **Dockerfile Contents:** The primary content is the "Dockerfile" itself. It contains a series of commands:\n * `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm` (Base image)\n * Commands to install dependencies using `apt-get` and `pip`.\n * Instructions to download and install `uv` (a package manager).\n * Setting the working directory to `/app` using `WORKDIR /app`.\n * Copying application files (`app.py`) into the `/app` directory using `COPY app.py /app`.\n * A command to explicitly set the correct binary path for `uv` and run the application using `CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]`.\n4. **User & Commit Information:** The header near the top indicates the user "GauraVinDex" and the initial commit message.\n5. **Code Annotations:** A red arrow points to the line "COPY app.py /app", and a red box highlights the `WORKDIR /app` line.\n\n**In essence, the image shows a Dockerfile used to build a containerized Python application with dependencies managed by `uv`, and the application is likely named "app.py".**Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 11.13.32 am2116×1512 323 KB
You only copied app.py into your docker image.
How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your repo clearly shows is needed?
Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.

I am getting license not present at root of github repo but i have the license added could someone please explain why ?
@thinkmachine
Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. 
However with regards to your long post…
Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.
What you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.
In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?

Because it does not deliver what was required,
Wastes valuable time and resources
Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)
Complicates testing
Leads to scope creep

His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.
I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.
For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).
Kindest regards
Hi Sir,
I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag “abhay227/version1” instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is 4db729a03f74 , which is part of version1 that is already present and publicly available.
I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1 form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.
Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your positive response.

Hi Abhay,
This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.
Kind regards
Hi sir, hope you are doing well.
Could you please check and let me know if I have passed the project 1 and if yes then how much am I scoring in Project 1 after the latest evaluation?
@carlton
Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton. It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.
Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible within the scope of the problem statement.
What began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. 
(…caution: long post ahead )
I noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python &amp; Shell use. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.
Some might suggest using temperature=0 to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.
Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.
At the core of it, it’s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.
Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,

Reason about the task, understand intent,
Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)
Execute those workflows (walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.
Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.

Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.
To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools:

A REPL executor (for quick calcs)
A Python script runner
A Shell executor

With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.
As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training &amp; tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was emergent behavior, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!
I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team &amp; @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really!
As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.
PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. 

TL;DR
My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.
Kind regards

Hi @Srishty_Snehi
Your submission is valid, we but it failed while running server, with this error.
taskA module missing
For regenerating this error:

Pull github repo(latest commit before 18th Feb)
Build image using Dockerfile of fetched repo
Run that image.

We are not considering Dockerfile’s with wrong name(anything other than Dockerfile), and wrong location(anything other than root) in github repo.
Will I still get a zero?
Can we expect the results for project 1 and 2 by tomorrow? @carlton @Jivraj
when can we expect our project 1 result?
@Jivraj
I got my result!! 2/20 so happy its not a 0 thank you for the bonus @carlton @Jivraj

Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given – Repository Was Public with All Required Files
Dear @Carlton sir
I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.

My GitHub repository was public at the time of submission.
I had included the Dockerfile as required.
I also added the MIT License to the project.
For your reference, I am also attaching a snapshot of the repository as it was during the submission time.

Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a concrete reason for giving zero marks. I’m eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself. But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and not having mit licsence .

please just check my repo  manually  and clarify whether it was public or not . What is going on this degree .
And also i ran the evaluate.py and got the 10/10 during submission , atleast you can give 4-5 by which i can pass this course .
Hi sir
I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.
During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I’m a bit confused about the change.
Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir
Thank you
Dear @carlton Sir,
I was getting 8 marks in your evaluation but today I checked the mail, I was awarded 0 marks. I am not sure what happened. Everything was in place. I would really appreciate if you can provide a reason for zero marks. I rechecked everything and looks good. Awaiting your reply. Thanks.
Here\'s a point-by-point description of the image:\n\n* **Text Content:** The image primarily consists of text.\n* **"BIO FAILED"**: A phrase indicating a failure related to a biological process or identification.\n* **"Score: 8 / 20"**: This indicates a score of 8 out of a possible 20. \n* **"HTTP Request: POST https://aipro..."**: This line describes an HTTP request using the POST method to a URL that begins with "https://aipro...". The URL is truncated.\n* **Visual Elements**: There is a target icon before the "Score" line.\n* **Background**: The background appears to be a light gray color.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the image seems to display results from a system evaluating something, possibly related to biological identification, with a score of 8 out of 20 and an associated HTTP request log.image452×132 6.53 KB

Respected sir,
I have passed all pre-requisites however my file wasn’t evaluated due to port error (127.0.0.1). Please allow me rectify it as it everything else has passed and is in accordance to the guidelines and I had worked really hard for it not to be evaluated only.
Dear @carlton Sir,
I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.
Thank you.
Respected Sir,
I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.
According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1_evaluation_error_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number.
Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.
Thank you for your time and assistance!
@carlton i am sure i had cleared 8/10 test cases in part A of the project despite rigrous checking and no error was found my be but still i have been alloted 0 in all the cases , this is no small issue as project holds a significant amount of weightage in the end term
I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did
Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this term or not.
I am facing the exact same issue

But in email u said n , your repo was not public, even not had dockerfile nor mit licence that’s what I mentioned.
Your repo is not public! Thats why we cannot see any other files either. If its not public we cannot see if other files exist. We cannot evaluate an invisible repo.
I got email , your repo was not public even had not a dockerfile nor mit licence, that’ what I mentioned.
My repo is public even before it was. How can I set to public..thisis same n while creating new repo u just select the public and not private that’s it n.
What else I can do . For public.
You misspelt your repo. Did you even check the post i sent with your details?

Things i have done for my project to work locally:



 carlton:

git clone &lt;your repo url&gt;


cloned my repo which looked like this after cloning(ignore those green dots)
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Overall Impression:** The image shows a snippet of a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) interface, likely Visual Studio Code, displaying a project structure.\n* **Project Name:** The top-level project is named "TDS_PROJECT_1" and it\'s currently expanded, indicated by the downward-facing arrow. \n* **File Structure:** Beneath the project, there\'s a file or folder named "tds-project-1" with a green dot indicator, which could signify a virtual environment or active project.\n* **File Type:** Beneath "tds-project-1", there is a file called "LICENSE" indicated with a license icon. \n* **Color Scheme:** The interface uses a dark theme, with green, blue and white text against a black background.\n* **Icons:** The interface uses icons to denote different elements of the project structure.\n* **Toolbar Elements:** Above the project name there are some icons that may represent project configuration/settings.image274×118 2.87 KB
All the files are  in this folder (I wasn’t aware that we cannot have the subfolder in the root directory,I shouldn’t get penalized for this) and added the datagen and evaluate.py file.



 carlton:

Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder


when i do this( ) i get this error



 carlton:

docker build -t &lt;your image name&gt;


PS D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1&gt; docker build -t "tushar2k5/tds-project-1"                                                                 
ERROR: "docker buildx build" requires exactly 1 argument.
See 'docker buildx build --help'.

Usage:  docker buildx build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

Start a build

Instead,in order to run the docker image successfully  we have to do either of the two things(taken help from chatgpt ):
1)
Use full path (recommended if you're outside the project folder):

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1

OR
2)
Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 .

Both the things work for me()



 carlton:

Dockerfile has to be inside root of any github repo, this is standard and we had discussion with Professor Anand about such cases where it’s not part of root directory, he suggested we will consider only Dockerfile being present in root folder of the repo.

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have to move files  in the repo please consider it)@carlton @Saransh_Saini @s.anand

Good evening sir.
My original project evaluation conducted by IITM gave me 7/20, however the new evaluation gave me 0/20.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a text-based log file or console output, likely from a data processing or machine learning task. It details a series of HTTP requests and responses, interspersed with status updates and error messages. \n\n**Key elements observed:**\n\n1. **File Name:** The filename at the top indicates "23fi002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.evaluation.log" suggesting this is an evaluation log file for a student or project.\n2. **HTTP Requests:** Numerous "HTTP Request" lines showing POST and GET requests to `http://localhost:8301/`. These requests appear to involve tasks like converting data, reading/writing files (`.html`, `.csv`), and running datasets.\n3. **HTTP Responses:** Corresponding "HTTP" response codes (e.g., 200, 400) are shown, indicating the success or failure of the requests. \n4. **Error Messages:**\n * "B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html" and "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" – indicating file access issues. \n * "HTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request" – an error message suggesting an issue with the request format. \n * "Failed to establish a new connection" - An error message implying a network or server issue.\n5. **Task Descriptions**: The log shows tasks like converting data (`Convert https://raw.githubusercontent.com...`), running datasets (`uvx datasette /data...`), and counting rows/selecting data.\n6. **Score**: Towards the bottom, a "Score: 7 / 20" is visible, suggesting this is an evaluation or grading output.\n7. **Color Coding:** The errors "B9 FAILED" and "B10 FAILED" are highlighted in red, visually indicating issues.\n\n**In essence**, the image portrays the execution log of a data processing pipeline, highlighting file access errors, bad requests, and the overall progress/score of the evaluation.image650×898 106 KB

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a console output, likely from a software development or data processing environment. It reports on a series of HTTP requests and their outcomes, along with a score.\n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n* **HTTP Requests:** Several HTTP requests are listed, detailing the method (GET or POST), URL, and HTTP status code.\n * A `GET` request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt` resulted in a "404 Not Found" error.\n * A `POST` request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` resulted in a "200 OK" response.\n* **Error Messages:**\n * "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt" is a prominent error message.\n * "C5 FAILED" is a highlighted error.\n* **Score:** A score of "7 / 25" is displayed, suggesting an evaluation metric of some kind.\n* **File Path:** The file path “C:\\Users\\choud\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\tds1\\TDS\\_Project\\_1” is shown.\n* **Console Tab:** Tabs are visible at the top: "Problems," "Output," "Debug Console," "Terminal," and "Ports".\n* **Color Scheme:** The console uses a dark background with red highlighting for errors and green for success.\n\n**In summary:** The image shows a console output indicating a failed attempt to read a file (`/data/c5.txt`) from a local server, alongside a successful request to an OpenAI embedding API endpoint and an overall score.image787×249 8.87 KB
Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of us were unaware. Please do consider this request.
Sir, could you please fetch my latest GitHub commit before 18th Feb and build the image through that one?
I received a mail saying that the Docker image is not accessible, but it is already there. Kindly request you to evaluate my submission.
Hi @Abhay222
Docker image submitted by you doesn’t exists.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image displays a "404 Not Found" error page from Docker Hub. It\'s a standard webpage displaying an error message indicating that the requested resource could not be found.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Background:** The background is dark blue/black.\n* **Central Graphic:** A large, circular graphic dominates the center of the screen, featuring a blue background.\n* **Error Message:** Prominently displayed within the circle is the number "404", indicating a "Not Found" error. Below it reads "Oops! The page you have requested was not found."\n* **Illustration:** There is a small illustration within the circular graphic depicting a robot or machine with a question mark on its screen.\n* **Docker Hub Branding:** The Docker Hub logo and name are visible in the top left corner.\n* **URL:** The URL in the address bar reads `https://hub.docker.com/r/abhay227/version1/tags`.\n* **Search Bar:** A search bar is present at the top, allowing users to search for Docker images.\n* **Navigation Buttons:** There are standard browser navigation buttons (back, forward, refresh) and a settings icon.\n* **Sign In/Sign Up Buttons:** In the upper right corner, there are "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons.\n\n**Context:** This image indicates an attempt to access a specific Docker image tag (`version1`) on Docker Hub has failed, likely because the tag does not exist, the repository is private, or there\'s a typo in the URL.image1902×943 93.3 KB
Hi @23f1000879
This basically tells you didn’t validate docker Dockerfile and docker image by building and running them, otherwise you would have corrected the mistake.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image shows a dark-themed screen likely from a version control or data management system. It displays information about a specific version ("version1") and its details. \n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n1. **Version Label:** The label "version1" indicates the name of the tracked version.\n\n2. **Last Published Information:** Text reads "Last pushed about 1 month by ahhay222", showing when and by whom the version was last updated. \n\n3. **Data Table:**\n * **Columns:** The information is arranged in a table with columns labeled "Digest", "OS/ARCH", "Last pull", and "Compressed size".\n * **Row 1:**\n * **Digest:** "4b2728601c14"\n * **OS/ARCH:** "linux/amd64"\n * **Last pull:** "about 1 month"\n * **Compressed size:** "241.98 MB"\n\n4. **File Path:** The path "docker_pull_ahhay222/tags/project/version1" is shown.\n\n5. **Copy Button:** A blue "Copy" button is present, suggesting the ability to copy the shown file path or related data.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe image is a system-generated report about a version of a project. It shows the version’s digest, operating system, architecture, last pull date, and compressed size. The user interface is dark and minimalist, resembling a data management tool or command-line application output.Screenshot 2025-04-02 1322141843×250 18.1 KB

Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.”
If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?
We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!
Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.
In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.
@carlton @Jivraj
Dear Sir,
I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found.
I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is
CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”]  has an invisible Unicode non-breaking space (U+00A0) between "run", "app.py" instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command.
I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE.  Expecting a positive response from your end.
sir, but before submission i run evluate.py and it gave me 8/10 in task A. after submission i also got result mail stating that i got 8/20.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image shows a screenshot of a text-based log file within a web browser. The log appears to be from a software execution process, likely involving data processing and web requests.

Sir, I realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag "abhay227/version1" instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is 4db729a03f74, which is part of version1 and is already present and publicly available.
Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any notification about this issue after submission. Receiving this mail at this stage feels disheartening after all the effort I’ve put into the project.  I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

My roll number is 23f1001524 .
@carlton and @Jivraj , for Task A i had tested before and all the test cases passed, but all my A tasks has failed with 0, In the evaluation logs, i could see that all task A tests failed due to datagen.py not available.
Could you rerun the test ?
Respected Sir,
Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.
Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment
I cloned my repository using:
bash
git clone &lt;my_repo_url&gt;
cd &lt;my_repo_directory&gt;
I built the Docker image using:

bash
docker build -t.
I ran the Docker container with:

bash
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000

I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.

Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:

bash
uvicorn evaluate.py --email=&lt;any_email&gt; --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

Issue with Original Submission
After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.
However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.
I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.
Action Taken
To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:
The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.
It responds to requests within the required timeframe.
I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:
Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest
Request for Re-Evaluation
I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.
Previous Message for Reference
For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:
"Greetings, Sir,
I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.
To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.
I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.
Thank you for your assistance!"
same for me
my roll number is 23f1003094
Same with me sir @carlton
There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that 
import requests
import pandas 
DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
try : 
    response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
    fetch_commit = None
    if response.status_code == 200:
        commits = response.json()
        for commit in commits:
            sha = commit["sha"]
   …
  

Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.
You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.
Kind regards
You can take it up with @s.anand
I did not come up with the standard.
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol.
Kindest regards.

The overall status appears to be a failing score (0), but a bonus and P1 score of 1 were earned.image1315×732 45.7 KB
MOST importantly mail shows :
Your final t score calculation is based on
MIN (20, (task score + bonus))
Github repo submitted: GitHub - 23f2001390/llmagent
Docker repo submitted: 23f2001390/llmagent
Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1
Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1
Your task score is: 0
Your bonus is: 1
Your P1 score is: 1

So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have mentioned that:
We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.
but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker_logs.zip or evaluation_logs.zip  that has been given in the mail(latest), if I passed the pre requisites my logs should be there in the zip files included in this latest mail right, my roll number is 23f2001390 and email id is 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
and nor do i find my id in the p1_evaluation_error_logs so please help sir

Hi Hari,
Your docker failed to build.
Did you try to replicate the test environment as mentioned in




Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science


    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that 
import requests
import pandas 
DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
try : 
    response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
    fetch_commit = None
    if response.status_code == 200:
        commits = response.json()
        for commit in commits:
            sha = commit["sha"]
   …
  

If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs.
90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo.
The specific error in your case is:
tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists
Thats why there are no logs.
Kind regards
Hello @carlton Sir, please reply to my query
We cannot allow changes to repos. This is a blanket rule for everyone. No exceptions. Since the only way to get your project to work is to make changes to it, we cannot score you for changes.
Kind regards
Thanks for the response. We can go on endless discussions using “nice words” “professionally” with the number of questions we have. Finally we are at the receiving end as students in this setup.
What’s the take away for everyone? Let’s move on. This isn’t the end.
Positive or Negative - Real world outside will make everyone realise and everyone change their opinions (including me) as the time and environment changes.
What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.
Hi I have my Dockerfile saved as dockerfile, given 0 for project 1 due to this. This doesn’t seem to be a big issue to grade me 0 for this. Kindly correct the score please.
Most common reason for during running docker image was taskA module was missing which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage.
For you check failed because of the naming of Dockerfile(It was named as dockerfile(d in small).
This is error that you got while building docker image using docker file in your github repo tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists
In your Dockerfile you are trying to copy requirements.txt but it doesn’t exists in the directory where Dockerfile is located

23f1003094


While running docker image create by your github repo, we got following error taskA module missing
For regenerating it follow steps that are mentioned here : Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies - #316
For you naming of MIT License was not correct.
This shows naming criteria for adding License.
Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs
Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically
when:
uv run app.py is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building).
my dockerfile from the repo:
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh &amp;&amp; rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy application files
COPY *.py /app/
COPY .env /app/

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

here u can see it installs using pip install …
here it’s requiring .env file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had .env file for AIPROXY_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that .env file but as git doesn’t allow upload of .env file I couldn’t upload.env to git
the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because.env file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn’t have the .env file so it didn’t build so I had to create the .env file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the .env file(it supports both.env file and environment variable one)
After filling form you didn’t double check form.



 Abhay222:

I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.


We can’t reconsider it.
Yes problem was missing .env file, Your repo, was supposed to run in a test environment.
Yes sir, please help me
Sorry We can’t do any help, we won’t be considering for eval.
But sir, It was supposed to run right…
It Should build in any test environment using Dockerfile from your github repo.
@Jivraj please tell me what was my mistake?
It was named wrongly.
You named it LICENCE but it should be LICENSE or LICENSE.md.
But sir, just because the repository doesn’t have .env file it couldn’t build the dockerimage, the docker image will build in any test environment as u said but it requires the .env to be included which the git didn’t have(it doesn’t allow upload of it ofcourse), don’t rerun the evaluation again but please sir atleast give me those 7/20 marks along with the pre-requisite bonus(1mark) that was mailed earlier to me along with logs…this is my primary degree after 12th, I’m also not asking any extra marks just the marks that i got earlier:
Here\'s a detailed description of the image you sent:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a web page displaying a log file with error messages related to a data processing task.

    You can take it up with @s.anand 
I did not come up with the standard. 
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files. 

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in. 

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand i…
  

Runned for you, it A1 Fails.
Your docker image and github repo are not consistent,  your docker image was not built with the latest code before 18th feb that’s present in your github repo.
We can’t consider any changes after deadline.
Your docker image and github repo are not consistent.
While running docker image we got following error: flask module missing
For regenerating this error follow steps mentioned in below post.

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that 
import requests
import pandas 
DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
try : 
    response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
    fetch_commit = None
    if response.status_code == 200:
        commits = response.json()
        for commit in commits:
            sha = commit["sha"]
   …
  

Anything after deadline we can’t consider any changes, it was just a matter of time, you didn’t tests running evaluate.py on docker container that was created, otherwise you would have spotted this mistake and rectified it.
In your github repo, Dockerfile should be named as Dockerfile(D caps).
I don’t know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker image.
Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems.
LLM won’t provide same results every time, for that reason we have give bonus marks.
@carlton @jivraj sir it is my humble request to do something. We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.
Sir but i did test my project via evaluate.py and got the 8/10 in my tasks A. A simple port error has resulted in no evaluation at all after all the hardwork.
Sir, how my git repo is not consistent i used the same repo which i have given you in the form even i did not commit any changes after 18th feb also in my docker file there is just a simple mistake that i forgot to add flask dependency just because of that mistake i am losing my marks. I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effort’s.
Dear Sir,
I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.
Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.
With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.
Hi @23f1001524 @afsalshah @23f1000879 @23f1002056
I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.
We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.
A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.
Critical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.
I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.
Kindest regards
Hi @carlton ,
I couldn’t find my Docker logs or evaluation logs in the latest result mail, even though I had passed the prerequisites. I also tried reproducing the test environment and scored 9/25 (screenshot attached below).
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a terminal window displaying the results of HTTP requests. The window has a dark background.\n\n**Key elements:**\n\n* **HTTP Request Log:** The top line shows an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt`. The request resulted in an "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error".\n* **Error Message:** Below the request log, there\'s a red-colored message: "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt".\n* **Failed Indicator:** A red "X" symbol is displayed next to "C5 FAILED".\n* **Score:** "Score: 9 / 25" is written in red.\n* **Successful Request:** At the bottom, there\'s an HTTP POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`, and it\'s reported as "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".\n\n**Interpretation:** The image indicates that a request to read the file `/data/c5.txt` on a local server failed, resulting in a server error. This failure has contributed to a lower score (9 out of 25). However, a separate request to an external API endpoint (`aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev`) was successful.image1124×268 9.8 KB
Would really appreciate it if you could take a look. Thanks in advance!
Did you follow these instructions when building the test environment? Our logs indicated that this was the problem:
tried copying multiple files for that you need to give directory name and it should end with a /

Not able to see the my id in 22f3002723 in evaluation logs or docker logs.. just curious if there was  any issues in creating the image out of github ?
Thanks for the fixes (I have updated the code now). It was put together quickly and not tested before we actually posted it.
Happy to help sir

Thank you,

We are checking you submission. We will get in touch shortly.
@carlton @jivraj @s.anand,
I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.
I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.
I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.
I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.
I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.
Thank you for your time and understanding.
Issues with your submission has been resolved.
Thanks for raising the issue and checking it at your end.
Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.

Thank you
Yes,the Same case happend to me also we have put lot of efforts in this project but after seeing that in mail you have no mit licence, I added that license but with name of mit license actually to just name that license file as MIT license but due to this all our hardwork is just an experience but actually we are not awarding any marks in project1 . I request the TDS team to consider this issue.
I have passed the pre requisites, but there is no log file for my email.
At least docker logs should be there, right?
Was it missed by any chance?

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv. 
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]
# ///

import requests
import datetime as dt
import zoneinfo

I think the mistake would have been because in my repo the file name is “dockerfile” and you have mentioned it as “Dockerfile” . So is it a mistake to put “D” in lowercase.
Kindly look into this sir because of this I got 0 in project 1 even though many of the tasks of my projects passed the evaluation test.

For dockerfile you have in repo, It was named differently, correct naming has to be Dockerfile.

    You can take it up with @s.anand 
I did not come up with the standard. 
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files. 

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in. 

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand i…
  

@24ds1000119 and @YaswanthVaddi
We are not considering mismatch in naming for License.
Dear @carlton
This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the
/app/app/main.py     file is missing. However, in my project directory, the
main.py   file is located in the   app/   folder, and the   run.py   file is in the root folder of the project, which is   LLM_Automation_Agent  . This structure allows the run.py file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from app/main.py.
To run the project, the command I used is:
python run.py

Since run.py is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to app/main.py.
I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the run.py script located in the root folder (llm-automation-agent).
For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.
Here is the GitHub link to my project:

Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays information related to a GitHub repository.\n* **Repository Name:** The repository is named "llm-automation-agent" and is owned by the user "ksenthukumaran1805200."\n* **Metrics:** The image shows the following metrics for the repository:\n * **Contributors:** 1\n * **Issues:** 0\n * **Stars:** 0\n * **Forks:** 0\n* **Visual Elements:**\n * A pixelated abstract graphic is located in the top-right corner.\n * The GitHub logo is in the bottom right.\n* **Background:** The background is a light teal color.\n* **Overall Impression:** This appears to be a relatively new or inactive GitHub repository with no contributions, issues, stars, or forks as of the time the image was captured.

Same here sir, i only changed LICENSE to MIT LICENSE due to the mail i received.
The LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project. The change too was made on the 16th of Feb.
Sir, I would highly appreciate if you consider it as the rest of the pre-requisites are working well.Due to this, the project is also not being evaulated.

Oh I see what happened, the image names are different, I don’t know how, given I pushed the latest at 11:51pm and submitted the form at 11:59pm. Thank You @Jivraj for showing me.
Question: Now that I know. how can I test the container myself, if I want to do exactly what you guys are doing?
My code uses npx to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...]), which assumes that npx is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or npx, this results in an error during evaluation.
To test the functionality correctly, npx must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:
bash: apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y nodejs npm
Once installed, npx prettier@3.4.2 should work as expected.
For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where npx is available by default.
@Jivraj @carlton

Dear Sirs,

Github repo submitted: GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent
Docker repo submitted: wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent
The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the app.py file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.
I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the app.py file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:
https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py.
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent.
Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.
I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.
Thank You and Regards,

Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a terminal or command-line interface. It displays error messages and traceback information related to a Python script, likely involved in generating credit card images.\n\n**Key Elements and Details:**\n\n1. **Text-Based Output:** The majority of the image consists of text, presenting a stack trace and error messages.\n2. **Initial Installation Message:** At the very top, it indicates that 3 packages were installed in 39ms using a tool likely named \'faker\'.\n3. **Traceback Blocks:** There are two distinct traceback blocks, which are sections that show the sequence of function calls that led to an error.\n * The first traceback originates from a file named `/tmp/datagen6arsl.py` at line 220. It involves functions related to image fonts using the PIL (Pillow) library. The error message is "OSError: cannot open resource".\n * The second traceback occurs during the handling of the previous exception, starting from the same file at line 303.\n4. **File Paths:** The tracebacks include numerous file paths, pointing to Python libraries and system directories, specifically involving the PIL (Pillow) library. This indicates that the error likely occurs when trying to load or process font resources.\n5. **Font information:** The font being used is `arial.ttf` at size 60.\n6. **Error Message:** The main error message is "OSError: cannot open resource", suggesting a problem with accessing a font file or other resource needed for image creation. \n\n**In summary:** The image showcases a Python script failing due to a resource access error (specifically, a font file) when attempting to generate a credit card image, with detailed traceback information for debugging.image1298×857 29.4 KB
I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.
Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/…
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.
Edit 2:
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.
Here\'s a point-by-point description of the image:\n\n* **Content:** The image displays a snippet of Python code.\n* **Code Functionality:** The code appears to be a script for parsing command-line arguments, setting configuration variables, creating directories, and then calling a series of functions (a2 through a10).\n* **Key Libraries:** The code utilizes the `argparse` and `os.path` modules.\n* **Argument Parsing:** The script defines two arguments: "email" and "--root" with a default value of "/data".\n* **Configuration:** It sets configuration variables \'email\' and \'root\' based on parsed arguments.\n* **Directory Creation:** The code attempts to create a directory specified by the \'root\' variable, ignoring potential existence errors.\n* **Disclaimer:** The code includes a disclaimer stating the script is subject to change.\n* **Function Calls:** The script then lists a series of function calls, named a2_format_markdown, a3_dates, a4_contacts, a5_logs, a6_locs, a7_email, a8_credit_card_image, a9_comments, and a10_ticket_sales, suggesting a workflow or data processing pipeline.\n* **Visual Characteristics:** The code is displayed in a simple text format, likely from a code editor or terminal. The text is black on a white background.image1027×510 11 KB
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.
Thank you.

Shivaditya

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.
Therefore it does not build.
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.
Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.
Kind regards
Your docker failed to build from your Dockerfile

Since we cannot build your docker from your Docker manifest file we cannot evaluate it.
Your container failed to run after building it.
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: exec: "uv": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown

Thats why we cannot evaluate it.
There is clearly some difference between both the applications. That is up to you to figure out. I can only tell whats wrong with yours. After building it and trying to run it this is the error we get. It fails to run as a result and we cannot evaluate it.

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.
Respected Sir,

Yes Sir, I said the same,  .env was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
when we download the repository it doesn’t have the .env file,
for docker image to build we need to add .env with AIPROXY_TOKEN
after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
As you said Sir that you will use separate AIPROXY_TOKEN…you can put that in .env file and build the docker image
after that Sir its optional to pass AIPROXY_TOKEN again while running the docker Image
just the .env file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable

and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:
git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git

adding .env with AIPROXY token and replacing evaluate.py and datagen.py with new ones according to test environment
docker build -t llm-agent .

docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
or
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent

and in another terminal
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

Thank you
Kind regards
Respected sir
I understand it’s my mistake sir and I apologize for that sir, but please consider this time sir since because of this my entire project score went from 9/20 to 0, which would make me difficult to pass this course and continue my diploma.
Please consider this request sir, sorry sir and this would never be repeated in future. My project evaluation was 9/20 initially sir, but later it came down to 0 because of this issue. Kindly consider sir please.

I tested the docker file in docker playground again.. Please find the screenshot of the docker build command and the log output of the docker build.. It went thru without issues..
Was the latest docker file used from git lab? Because as explained on March 30 i had to remove the hardcoded http/https proxies of  my office environment,
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a web-based interface for managing a Docker container, along with a terminal window. It appears to be a system for accessing and managing remote server instances.\n\n**Key Elements & Details:**\n\n1. **Browser Tab:** The browser tab displays the URL: `labs.play-with-docker.com/p/cvqlfo0l-cvqlfsol2o9000cd7icg`. This indicates an interactive Docker environment.\n2. **Time Display:** A large blue digital display shows the time "0:44:22", likely indicating the duration of a session.\n3. **Container Information:** A central rectangular section displays details about a Docker container:\n * **Container ID:** `cvqlfo0l-cvqlfsol2o9000cd7icg`\n * **IP Address:** `192.168.0.13`\n * **SSH Access:** A line showing `ssh ip172-18-0-93-cvqlfo0l2o9000cd7ic0@direct.labs.play` suggests the method for SSH access.\n * **Buttons:** "DELETE" and "EDITOR" buttons are present, allowing container management.\n4. **Resource Monitoring:** The display shows sections for "Memory" and "CPU", indicating resource usage monitoring.\n5. **Terminal Window:** A terminal window is visible at the bottom of the screenshot.\n * **Prompt:** The prompt indicates the user is logged in as root `@192.168.0.13`.\n * **Command:** A Docker build command is being executed: `$ docker build -t tdsproject1:latest . > tds-projbuild.log`. This suggests the user is building a Docker image from a local Dockerfile.\n6. **Browser Tabs:** Several browser tabs are visible at the top of the image, including YouTube videos, and potentially other resources related to the user\'s work.\n\n**Overall Context:** This image depicts a user working with a remote Docker container through an online platform ("play-with-docker"). They are likely building and testing a Docker image from the terminal.image (18)1272×671 64.7 KB

Was the latest docker file used from git lab


No, we are not allowing any changes to repo after deadline, this is consistent rule for every student. We pulled your github repo latest commit before 18th feb, I am getting following error.
follow the steps mentioned in post below

To test the functionality correctly, npx must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:


That destroys the purpose of containerization, your container should run anywhere anytime, all the dependencies must be preinstalled.
Thanks @carlton @Jivraj
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had  my office proxy url’s set as http_proxy and https_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.
Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,
Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..
It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.
Subject: Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1
@carlton @Jivraj
Sir,
Regarding the recent feedback on Project 1 for TDS, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named dockerfile (not Dockerfile). Please verify the repository again with this in mind.
Additionally, my Docker image architecture is linux/amd64 (64-bit x86). I have also filled out the Architecture Information Collector form as requested.
Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1
Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0

Sir, I had posted the query on A8 and datagen exception. Is this a reply to that?
oh yeah sorry, hit the reply to the wrong button, but yes its to your post.
I’ve got good news for you and 30 other students. Thanks to your diligent debugging effort that we were able to find this bug. For now the fix is that we will not evaluate you on a8 and catch the datagen exception so as to not cause cascading failures.
Thanks and kind regards.
We will let you know the outcome of the evaluations soon.
@carlton @Jivraj
any way out for my earlier query ?
@carlton
Thank you for the reply .But it was working when i ran the initial evalaute.py .If you don’t  mind could you tell what may have caused this to happen.
Hi Hilal,
You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post




Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science


    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv. 
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]
# ///

import requests
import datetime as dt
import zoneinfo
import argparse
import os
import zipfile

parser = argparse.…
  

That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.
The specific error itself means:
Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container.
If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.
Kind regards
sir for my project 1 i got a mail stating that the docker file isn’t public and that’s why prerequisite failed. but i checked it and it seemed absolutely perfect to me. Please look into this issue as my docker repo is public and absolutely as per the requirement.  @carlton @Jivraj
Hi @22f3003083
Following was your submission, which is not a valid dockerrepo.
Here\'s a detailed description of the image:\n\n* **Content Type:** The image shows a snippet of code, likely from a version control system like Git (specifically, a view from a platform like GitHub or GitLab).\n* **UI Elements:**\n * **Tab Bar:** A tab bar at the top with options like "Preview," "Code," and "Blame" is visible.\n * **Search Bar:** A search bar is present with the input "2283003083/v1".\n * **Table/Data View:** The main content is a table with the following columns:\n * **Timestamp:** Dates and times.\n * **Email Address:** Email addresses.\n * **Column 3:** A URL or link with the format "https://github.com/2283003083/1/05, Project 1".\n * **Column 4:** Appears to be a shortened identifier like "2283003083/v1".\n* **Data:** The table contains at least one row of data. The timestamp in the first row is "2018/05/23 22:26:17", with the associated email address "2283003083@study.aimtech.in".\n* **Color Scheme:** The image uses a dark color scheme, typical for code editors and terminal windows.\n* **Overall Impression:** This appears to be a commit history or log within a Git repository. The data likely relates to contributions or changes made to a project, possibly with information about the author (email address) and the commit details.image1829×251 22 KB
Now I feel so good getting 0.
0 is best.
@carlton @Jivraj
As requested earlier, Could you please reevaluate my submission.  The only change that had to be done post Feb 18 checkin was to remove my office proxies on Mar 30 from the docker file  to make it work in all environments.. It  would be great if this could be accomodated..
Hi Jayaram,
Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo, regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes.
Kind regards
Thanks for the response @carlton ..  just a small suggestion, to avoid scenarios like what i faced and also with softwares like docker/podman not being too windows friendly, i think students can find it easier if a dev/mock  linux env is provided for course term duration, instead of   everyone having to figuring out with AWS/Azure and all providers.. Anyway thanks and appreciate all the help
Sir, I have done everything for my project, but I am getting zero. I have uploaded my Docker file, but the email says it is not public. Sir, this is affecting my grades — please help me out. @Carlton

Sir, could you please check it once more? I think the issue has been resolved. @carlton @Jivraj
Since repo was not public during evaluation, we won’t be rechecking, or reevaluating.
@Jivraj I’ve completed all the required steps, but I’m still getting 0, It was working fine before. Could you please help me identify what might be going wrong?
Hi @21f3003107
You need to look it up yourself, We have sent out evaluation log and docker log files, check those out.
Evaluation script and other scripts that we have used are there in github repository over here.

@carlton
Thank you i found my mistake in my docker file i wrote  this  CMD [“uv”, “run”, “app.py”]  instead of
CMD [“uvicorn”, “main:app”, “–host”, “0.0.0.0”, “–port”, “8000”].Now i think everything works fine
Sir my repo was public
Sir any news on this? Did my score increase at all? My dashboard still shows the old score.
@carlton sir, my project 1 marks have still not increased even though while during evaluation it shows 4/10 for the task 1. It was said that the docker image prerequisite will be removed and without that the evaluation would be done, but there is still no change in my marks. please look into it once, as my dashboard currently reflects 0 for project 1.
